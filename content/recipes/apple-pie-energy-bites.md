## Ingredients

- 1 cup dates, pitted
- 1 cup dried apples
- 1 cup rolled oats
- 1/2 cup almonds
- 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- Optional: 1/4 cup shredded coconut or chopped walnuts for rolling/coating

## Instructions

1. In a food processor, combine the dates, dried apples, rolled oats, and almonds. Process until well combined and the mixture resembles a coarse meal.
2. Add the applesauce, cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla extract, and salt to the food processor. Process until the mixture starts to stick together and forms a dough-like consistency.
3. If desired, place the shredded coconut or chopped walnuts in a separate bowl or plate for rolling or coating the energy bites.
4. Take small portions of the mixture and roll it into 1-inch diameter balls. If the mixture is too sticky, slightly wet your hands to make the rolling process easier.
5. Optional: Roll or coat the energy bites in shredded coconut or chopped walnuts, gently pressing them onto the surface of each energy bite for added texture and flavor.
6. Place the energy bites on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow them to firm up.
7. Once chilled, transfer the energy bites to an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to a week, or in the freezer for longer shelf life.
8. Enjoy your Apple Pie Energy Bites whenever you need a quick and healthy snack!

**Note:** Feel free to customize these energy bites by adding other ingredients like chia seeds, flaxseeds, or a touch of honey for added sweetness.
