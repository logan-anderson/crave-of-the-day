# Monster Mallows Recipe

### Ingredients:
- 24 large marshmallows
- 12 chocolate sandwich cookies (such as Oreos)
- 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
- 1/2 cup candy eyes or mini chocolate chips
- Assorted colorful gel icings (to decorate)

### Instructions:
1. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
2. Carefully twist apart the sandwich cookies and separate the cookie halves.
3. In a microwave-safe bowl, melt the semisweet chocolate chips in the microwave, stirring every 30 seconds until smooth and melted.
4. Holding a marshmallow with a fork or toothpick, dip it into the melted chocolate, coating it entirely. Tap the fork gently against the bowl's side to remove excess chocolate.
5. Press one marshmallow onto the cream side of each cookie half, allowing the excess chocolate to drip down the cookie.
6. While the chocolate is still warm, attach candy eyes or mini chocolate chips onto the marshmallow to create eyes and a mouth. Use the gel icings to draw other features such as eyebrows, hair, or scars on the marshmallow if desired.
7. Place the assembled monster mallows onto the prepared baking sheet and repeat the process with the remaining marshmallows and cookies.
8. Allow the monster mallows to set at room temperature until the chocolate hardens, or place them in the refrigerator for quicker setting.
9. Once the chocolate is set, serve and enjoy these cute and spooky monster mallows!

Note: Monster mallows can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.
