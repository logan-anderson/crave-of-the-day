2. In a medium bowl, combine the diced tomatoes, chopped red onion, chopped jalapeno pepper, cilantro, lime juice, minced garlic, salt, and black pepper. Mix well to combine all the ingredients. Set aside the salsa mixture to marinate for at least 15 minutes.
3. Cut the corn tortillas into quarters to create triangle-shaped chips.
4. Arrange the tortilla chips in a single layer on a baking sheet. 
5. Lightly spray the chips with cooking spray, and sprinkle with salt to taste.
6. Bake the tortilla chips in the preheated oven for about 10-12 minutes, or until they become crispy and golden brown.

8. Serve the fresh tomato salsa in a bowl alongside the baked tortilla chips. Enjoy!

Note: You can adjust the spiciness of the salsa by adding more or less jalapeno pepper, according to your taste preference.
