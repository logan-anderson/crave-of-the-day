Here's a recipe for Pecan Pie Bars:

Ingredients:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup powdered sugar
- 1 cup unsalted butter, cold and cubed
- 4 large eggs
- 1 1/2 cups light corn syrup
- 1 1/4 cups packed light brown sugar
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2 cups pecans, coarsely chopped

Instructions:

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.

2. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and powdered sugar. Using a pastry cutter or your fingertips, cut in the cold cubed butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.

3. Press the mixture evenly into the bottom of the greased baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until lightly golden brown.

4. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, corn syrup, brown sugar, melted butter, and vanilla extract until well combined.

5. Stir in the chopped pecans until they are evenly distributed throughout the mixture.

6. Pour the pecan filling over the baked crust, spreading it out evenly.

7. Return the baking dish to the oven and bake for an additional 25-30 minutes, or until the filling is set and golden brown on top.

8. Remove from the oven and allow the pecan pie bars to cool completely in the baking dish before cutting into slices.

9. Once cooled, cut into bars or squares and serve. These are delicious on their own, but you can also serve with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream if desired.
