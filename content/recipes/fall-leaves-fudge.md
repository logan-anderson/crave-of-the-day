# Fall Leaves Fudge Recipe

## Ingredients

- 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips
- 1 can (14 oz) sweetened condensed milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup chopped pecans
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- Leaf-shaped cookie cutter

## Instructions

1. Line an 8x8-inch baking dish with parchment paper, leaving some overhang for easy removal later.

2. In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the chocolate chips and sweetened condensed milk. Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring well in between, until the mixture is melted and smooth.

3. Stir in the vanilla extract, chopped pecans, cinnamon, and nutmeg, until well combined.

4. Pour the fudge mixture into the prepared baking dish and spread it evenly. Smooth the top with a spatula.

5. Place the baking dish in the refrigerator and let it chill for at least 2 hours, until the fudge is firm.

6. Once the fudge is firm, remove it from the baking dish using the parchment paper overhang. Place it on a cutting board.

7. Use a leaf-shaped cookie cutter to cut out individual fudge pieces. Carefully press the cookie cutter into the fudge and then lift it to remove each leaf shape.

8. Collect the fudge scraps and re-roll them to cut out more leaf shapes, if desired.

9. Serve the Fall Leaves Fudge on a platter or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator until ready to enjoy.

Note: You can decorate the fudge leaves with colored icing or edible glitter to enhance the fall theme.
