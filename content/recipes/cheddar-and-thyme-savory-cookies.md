# Cheddar and Thyme Savory Cookies

Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 12 minutes
Total time: 27 minutes
Yield: Approximately 24 cookies

## Ingredients
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 1/4 cups shredded cheddar cheese
- 1/4 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 large egg yolk

## Instructions
1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone mat.

2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, baking powder, and dried thyme until well combined.

3. In a separate large bowl, cream together the softened butter, shredded cheddar cheese, and grated Parmesan cheese until light and fluffy using an electric mixer or by hand.

4. Add the egg yolk to the cheese mixture and continue to mix until fully incorporated.

5. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the cheese mixture, mixing well after each addition, until a firm dough forms.

6. Roll the dough into small balls, approximately 1 inch in diameter, and place them onto the prepared baking sheet. Leave about 1 inch of space between each cookie to allow for spreading.

7. Using the back of a fork, gently press down on each cookie to create a crisscross pattern and slightly flatten them.

8. Bake in the preheated oven for about 12 minutes or until the edges turn golden brown.

9. Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

10. Once cooled, serve these delicious Cheddar and Thyme Savory Cookies and enjoy!

Note: These cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days.
