# Apple Caramel Chews Recipe

## Ingredients
- 4 medium-sized apples, any variety
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter
- 1 cup light corn syrup
- 1 can (14 oz) sweetened condensed milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Optional toppings:
  - Chopped nuts (such as pecans or almonds)
  - Sea salt flakes

## Instructions
1. Line an 8x8 inch baking dish with parchment paper and set aside.
2. Rinse the apples, then peel and core them. Cut the apples into small chunks and set aside.
3. In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter.
4. Stir in the granulated sugar and corn syrup until well combined.
5. Slowly pour in the sweetened condensed milk while stirring continuously.
6. Add the apple chunks to the saucepan and bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring constantly.
7. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for about 45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens and turns a caramel color.
8. Remove the saucepan from heat and stir in the vanilla extract.
9. Pour the hot caramel mixture into the prepared baking dish and spread it evenly.
10. Let the caramel cool to room temperature, then transfer it to the refrigerator and let it chill for at least 2 hours, or until firm.
11. Once the caramel chews have firmed up, remove them from the refrigerator and cut them into small squares or desired shapes.
12. If desired, sprinkle chopped nuts or sea salt flakes on top of each caramel chew.
13. Wrap the individual chews in wax paper or store them in an airtight container in a cool place.
