## Ghostly Gummies Recipe

### Ingredients:
- 2 cups fruit juice (preferably a light-colored juice like apple or white grape)
- 4 tablespoons unflavored gelatin
- 1/4 cup honey or maple syrup
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Ghost-shaped gummy molds
- Cooking spray or vegetable oil (for greasing)

### Instructions:
1. Pour the fruit juice into a saucepan and sprinkle the gelatin over it. Stir gently to evenly distribute the gelatin.
2. Let the mixture sit for about 5 minutes to allow the gelatin to bloom.
3. Place the saucepan over low heat and warm the mixture, stirring constantly, until the gelatin is completely dissolved. Do not let it boil.
4. Remove the saucepan from heat and stir in the honey (or maple syrup) and vanilla extract until well combined.
5. Allow the mixture to cool slightly, then carefully pour it into the ghost-shaped gummy molds. 
   *Tip: To prevent sticking, lightly grease the molds with cooking spray or a small amount of vegetable oil.*
6. Place the filled molds in the refrigerator and chill for at least 2 hours or until the gummies are firm and fully set.
7. Once set, gently remove the gummies from the molds by pushing them out from the bottom or flexing the mold.
8. Serve the ghostly gummies immediately or store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week.

Enjoy the spooky and delicious ghostly gummies!
