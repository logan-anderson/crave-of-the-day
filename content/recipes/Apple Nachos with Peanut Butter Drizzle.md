# Apple Nachos with Peanut Butter Drizzle

## Ingredients:

- 2 crisp apples (such as Granny Smith or Honeycrisp), thinly sliced 
- 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter 
- 1/4 cup honey 
- 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips 
- 1/4 cup chopped peanuts 
- 2 tablespoons shredded coconut (optional)
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice

## Instructions:

1. In a small bowl, mix together the peanut butter and honey until well combined. Set aside.
2. In another small bowl, combine the lemon juice with 1 cup of water. Soak the apple slices in the lemon water for 2-3 minutes to prevent them from browning. Drain and pat dry.
3. Arrange the apple slices in a single layer on a large serving plate or platter.
4. Drizzle the peanut butter mixture all over the apple slices.
5. Sprinkle the mini chocolate chips, chopped peanuts, and shredded coconut (if using) over the top of the apple nachos.
6. Serve immediately and enjoy!

Note: You can get creative with toppings by adding a drizzle of caramel sauce, a sprinkle of cinnamon, or a handful of crushed pretzels for an extra crunch.
