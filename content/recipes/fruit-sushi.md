# Fruit Sushi Recipe

## Ingredients:
- Sushi rice: 2 cups
- Water: 2 cups
- Rice vinegar: 1/4 cup
- Sugar: 2 tablespoons
- Salt: 1/2 teaspoon
- Nori seaweed sheets: 4 sheets
- Assorted fruits: 
   - Mango: 1, sliced into strips
   - Strawberries: 10, quartered
   - Kiwi: 2, sliced into thin rounds
   - Pineapple: 1 cup, diced
   - Blueberries: 1/2 cup
   - Raspberries: 1/2 cup
- Soy sauce: for dipping (optional)
- Wasabi: for dipping (optional)
- Pickled ginger: for serving (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Rinse the sushi rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Drain the rice and place it in a medium-sized saucepan.
2. Add the water to the saucepan with the rice and bring it to a boil. Once boiling, lower the heat to low, cover the saucepan, and simmer for 15 minutes or until the rice is cooked and the water is absorbed.
3. While the rice is cooking, prepare the sushi vinegar mixture. In a small bowl, mix together rice vinegar, sugar, and salt until the sugar is dissolved.
4. Once the rice is cooked, remove it from the heat and let it sit, covered, for 10 minutes to cool slightly.
5. Transfer the cooked rice to a large bowl and pour the sushi vinegar mixture over the rice. Gently fold and mix the rice with a wooden spoon or spatula, ensuring all the rice is coated with the vinegar mixture. Allow the rice to cool completely.
6. Lay a sheet of nori seaweed on a clean surface or sushi mat. Wet your hands with water to prevent sticking, and take a handful of sushi rice, spreading it evenly over the nori, leaving a 1-inch border at the top.
7. Arrange your desired fruit fillings in a straight line across the center of the rice, about 1-2 inches wide.
8. Starting from the end closest to you, carefully roll the sushi, using the sushi mat or your hands to firmly shape it and seal the fruit inside. Apply gentle pressure throughout the rolling process to ensure it sticks together.
9. Once rolled, use a sharp knife to trim and discard the uneven ends. Cut the rolled sushi into bite-sized pieces, about 1 inch thick.
10. Repeat steps 6-9 with the remaining ingredients, using different fruit combinations for each roll.
11. Serve the fruit sushi immediately with optional soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger for dipping.
12. Enjoy this delightful and refreshing twist on traditional sushi!
