# Slow Cooker Cinnamon Applesauce Recipe

## Ingredients:
- 10 medium-sized apples (such as Granny Smith or Honeycrisp), peeled, cored, and chopped
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/4 cup white sugar
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

## Instructions:
1. Place the chopped apples, water, white sugar, brown sugar, lemon juice, and ground cinnamon in a slow cooker.
2. Stir well to evenly coat the apples with the sugar and cinnamon mixture.
3. Cover the slow cooker with a lid and cook on low heat for 6-8 hours or on high heat for 3-4 hours, until the apples are tender and easily mashed.
4. Once the apples are cooked, use a potato masher or fork to mash them to your desired consistency. For a chunky texture, mash them lightly, and for a smoother applesauce, mash them more thoroughly.
5. Taste the applesauce and adjust the sweetness and cinnamon levels according to your preference. You can add more sugar or cinnamon if desired.
6. If the applesauce is too watery, remove the lid from the slow cooker and cook on high heat for an additional 30 minutes to allow some of the moisture to evaporate, stirring occasionally.
7. Once the applesauce reaches your preferred consistency, turn off the slow cooker and let it cool for a few minutes.
8. Transfer the applesauce into airtight containers or jars and refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving.
9. Serve the Slow Cooker Cinnamon Applesauce chilled as a delicious and healthy snack, or use it as a topping for oatmeal, yogurt, pancakes, or ice cream.
10. Enjoy your homemade Slow Cooker Cinnamon Applesauce!

Note: This recipe yields about 4 cups of applesauce, and you can easily double or reduce the quantities to suit your needs.
