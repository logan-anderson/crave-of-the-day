## Ingredients:
- 8 medium-sized chicken drumsticks
- 8 wooden skewers
- 1 cup barbecue sauce
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Optional: Fresh herbs for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Soak the wooden skewers in water for at least 30 minutes to prevent burning while grilling.
2. In a small bowl, whisk together the barbecue sauce, olive oil, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper.
3. Preheat your grill to medium-high heat.
4. Prepare the chicken drumsticks by removing the skin and excess fat. Pat them dry with a paper towel.
5. Thread one skewer through the meaty end of each drumstick, pushing it all the way through until the stick pokes out of the opposite end.
6. Generously brush the barbecue sauce mixture over each drumstick, ensuring they are well coated.
7. Place the skewers on the preheated grill and cook for about 20-25 minutes, turning frequently and basting with the remaining sauce every few minutes, until the drumsticks are fully cooked and reach an internal temperature of 165째F (74째C).
8. Once cooked, transfer the skeleton skewers to a serving plate and let them rest for a couple of minutes.
9. Serve hot, optionally garnished with fresh herbs, and enjoy these spooky and delicious skeleton skewers!

**Note:** You can also prepare this recipe in the oven by baking the skewers at 400째F (200째C) for approximately 35-40 minutes, or until fully cooked and golden brown. Adjust the cooking time as needed.
