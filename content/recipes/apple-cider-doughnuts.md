# Apple Cider Doughnuts Recipe

## Ingredients:
- 2 cups apple cider
- 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar
- 3/4 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
- 2 large eggs
- 1/2 cup buttermilk
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- Vegetable oil (for frying)

## Instructions:
1. In a medium saucepan, bring the apple cider to a boil over medium heat. Cook for about 10-15 minutes or until the cider is reduced to 1/2 cup. Remove from heat and let it cool completely.

2. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, granulated sugar, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves.

3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the melted butter, eggs, buttermilk, vanilla extract, and cooled apple cider.

4. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not overmix.

5. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate the dough for at least 1 hour or overnight.

6. When ready to make the doughnuts, heat vegetable oil in a deep skillet or pot over medium heat. The oil should be about 3 inches deep.

7. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the chilled dough to a 1/2-inch thickness. Use a doughnut cutter or two different-sized biscuit cutters to cut out the doughnuts and doughnut holes.

8. Carefully drop a few doughnuts at a time into the hot oil, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Fry for 2-3 minutes per side or until golden brown.

9. Remove the doughnuts using a slotted spoon or tongs and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil. Repeat the frying process with the remaining doughnuts and holes.

10. Optional: While the doughnuts are still warm, roll them in a cinnamon-sugar mixture (1 cup granulated sugar mixed with 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon) until fully coated.

11. Serve the apple cider doughnuts warm and enjoy!

Note: These doughnuts are best when eaten fresh, but they can be stored in an airtight container for up to 2 days.
