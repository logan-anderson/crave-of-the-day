Here's a recipe for Cranberry Pecan Muffins:

## Ingredients:
- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
- 1/2 cup milk
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup fresh or frozen cranberries
- 1/2 cup chopped pecans

## Instructions:

1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease the cups.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
3. In a separate bowl, mix together the melted butter, milk, eggs, and vanilla extract until well combined.
4. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not overmix.
5. Gently fold in the cranberries and chopped pecans into the batter.
6. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups, filling each about 2/3 full.
7. Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.
8. Remove the muffin tin from the oven and allow the muffins to cool for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
9. Serve the muffins warm or at room temperature. Enjoy!

Note: If you're using frozen cranberries, there's no need to thaw them before adding to the batter.
