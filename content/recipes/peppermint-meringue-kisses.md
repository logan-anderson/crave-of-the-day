# Peppermint Meringue Kisses

## Ingredients:
- 3 large egg whites, at room temperature
- 3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
- 1/2 teaspoon peppermint extract
- Red food coloring (optional)
- Crushed candy canes, for garnish (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 200°F (93°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a clean mixing bowl, beat the egg whites on medium speed until frothy.
3. Add the cream of tartar and continue beating until soft peaks form.
4. Gradually add the sugar while beating on high speed until stiff peaks form and the mixture is glossy.
5. Gently fold in the peppermint extract.
6. Optionally, add a few drops of red food coloring and gently swirl it through the meringue mixture to create a marbled effect.
7. Transfer the meringue mixture into a piping bag fitted with a star tip.
8. Pipe small kiss-shaped mounds onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them at least 1 inch apart.
9. Sprinkle crushed candy canes over the meringue kisses for an extra festive touch, if desired.
10. Bake in the preheated oven for 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the meringues are dry and firm to the touch. Turn off the oven and let them cool completely inside.
11. Once cooled, carefully peel the meringue kisses off the parchment paper and serve.

Enjoy the light and airy peppermint meringue kisses as a delightful treat or as a festive addition to your holiday desserts!
