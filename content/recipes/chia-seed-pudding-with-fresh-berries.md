# Chia Seed Pudding with Fresh Berries

## Ingredients:
- 1/4 cup chia seeds
- 1 cup almond milk (or any non-dairy milk)
- 1 tablespoon sweeter of choice (e.g., honey, maple syrup, or agave)
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup fresh mixed berries (e.g., strawberries, blueberries, raspberries)

## Instructions:
1. In a medium bowl, combine chia seeds, almond milk, sweeter, and vanilla extract.
2. Stir well to ensure the chia seeds are evenly distributed.
3. Let the mixture set for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent clumps from forming.
4. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a lid and refrigerate overnight or for at least 4 hours to allow the chia seeds to absorb the liquid and thicken.
5. Once the pudding has set, give it a good stir to break up any clumps and achieve a creamy consistency.
6. Serve the chia seed pudding in individual bowls or glasses.
7. Top with fresh mixed berries and enjoy immediately.

Note: You can also add additional toppings like nuts, coconut flakes, or granola for extra flavor and texture.
