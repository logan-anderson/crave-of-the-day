# Christmas Cookie Bark Recipe

## Ingredients:
- 2 cups of chocolate chips (choose your favorite: milk chocolate, dark chocolate, or white chocolate)
- 1 cup of crushed Christmas-themed cookies (e.g., gingerbread cookies, candy cane cookies, sugar cookies)
- 1/2 cup of assorted festive sprinkles or edible glitter

## Instructions:
1. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or use a silicone baking mat and set it aside.
2. In a microwave-safe bowl, melt the chocolate chips in 30-second intervals, stirring well between each interval until smooth and fully melted.
3. Pour the melted chocolate onto the prepared baking sheet and spread it evenly with a spatula to create a thin layer.
4. Sprinkle the crushed Christmas cookies evenly over the melted chocolate layer, gently pressing them in.
5. Immediately sprinkle the festive sprinkles or edible glitter on top, making sure to cover the entire surface.
6. Place the baking sheet in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour to let the bark set.
7. Once the bark is firm, remove it from the refrigerator and break it into irregular pieces using your hands or a knife.
8. Serve the Christmas cookie bark on a platter or in holiday-themed packaging to share with family and friends.
9. Store the remaining bark in an airtight container at room temperature for up to one week.
