Sure! Here's a recipe for Sesame Crusted Tofu Sticks:

Ingredients:

- 1 block of tofu, extra firm
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 2 tablespoons honey or maple syrup
- 2 tablespoons sesame oil
- 1 cup panko breadcrumbs
- 1/4 cup sesame seeds
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- Cooking spray or oil, for greasing

Instructions:

1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease it with cooking spray or oil.

2. Drain the tofu and pat it dry with paper towels. Cut the tofu into sticks, about 1/2 inch wide and 3-4 inches long.

3. In a shallow bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, rice vinegar, honey or maple syrup, and sesame oil. Place the tofu sticks into the marinade and gently toss to coat. Allow the tofu to marinate for 10-15 minutes.

4. In a separate bowl, combine the panko breadcrumbs, sesame seeds, salt, and black pepper.

5. One by one, remove the tofu sticks from the marinade and roll them into the breadcrumb mixture, pressing gently to adhere the crumbs. Place the coated tofu sticks onto the prepared baking sheet.

6. Once all the tofu sticks are coated, lightly spray or brush them with cooking spray or oil. This will help them turn golden and crispy.

7. Bake the tofu sticks in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until they are crispy and golden brown.

8. Remove the sesame crusted tofu sticks from the oven and allow them to cool slightly before serving. They can be enjoyed as is, or served with your favorite dipping sauce.

9. Enjoy your delicious Sesame Crusted Tofu Sticks!

Note: You can customize this recipe by adding additional spices such as garlic powder, paprika, or chili flakes to the breadcrumb mixture for extra flavor if desired.
