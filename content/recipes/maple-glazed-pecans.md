# Recipe: Maple Glazed Pecans

## Ingredients:
- 2 cups pecan halves
- 1/3 cup pure maple syrup
- 1/4 cup brown sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

## Instructions:
1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a medium-sized bowl, combine the maple syrup, brown sugar, vanilla extract, ground cinnamon, and salt. Mix well until the sugar has dissolved.
3. Add the pecan halves to the bowl and toss them with the maple syrup mixture until they are evenly coated.
4. Spread the coated pecans in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, stirring once halfway through, until the pecans are golden brown and fragrant.
6. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and let the pecans cool completely.
7. Once cooled, the maple glazed pecans are ready to serve and enjoy.

**Note:** Store any leftover pecans in an airtight container at room temperature for up to two weeks.
