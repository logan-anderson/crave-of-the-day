## Recipe: Butterscotch-Spiced Pretzels

### Ingredients:
- 1 ½ cups pretzels, any shape or size
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- ½ cup packed brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons heavy cream
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ¼ teaspoon ground cloves
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- Cooking spray, for greasing

### Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a baking sheet with cooking spray and set aside.
2. In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the brown sugar, heavy cream, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and salt. Stir well until the mixture combines and starts to bubble slightly. Remove from heat.
3. Place the pretzels in a large mixing bowl. Pour the melted butterscotch sauce over the pretzels, ensuring they are well-coated. Mix gently with a spatula or your hands until all the pretzels are evenly coated.
4. Transfer the coated pretzels onto the prepared baking sheet, spreading them out in a single layer.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the pretzels are caramelized and crispy. Make sure to stir or toss the pretzels halfway through baking to ensure even browning.
6. Remove from the oven and let the pretzels cool completely on the baking sheet before serving.
7. Once cooled, transfer the butterscotch-spiced pretzels to an airtight container for storage. They can be enjoyed immediately or kept for up to one week.
