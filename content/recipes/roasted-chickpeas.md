## Roasted Chickpeas Recipe

### Ingredients:
- 1 can (15.5 oz) chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained and rinsed
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper

### Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
2. Pat dry the chickpeas using paper towels to remove any excess moisture.
3. In a bowl, combine the dried chickpeas, olive oil, cumin, paprika, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper. Toss well to evenly coat the chickpeas with the spices.
4. Spread the seasoned chickpeas in a single layer on a baking sheet.
5. Roast in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the chickpeas are crunchy and golden brown. Make sure to shake the baking sheet every 10 minutes to ensure even cooking and prevent sticking.
6. Once done, remove the chickpeas from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes before enjoying as a healthy snack or adding them to salads or bowls.

Enjoy your delicious and protein-packed roasted chickpeas!
