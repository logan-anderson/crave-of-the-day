# Watermelon Mint Popsicles Recipe
---

### Ingredients:
- 4 cups seedless watermelon, chopped
- 1/4 cup fresh mint leaves
- 1 tablespoon lime juice
- 2 tablespoons honey (optional, adjust to taste)

### Instructions:
1. Place the chopped watermelon, mint leaves, lime juice, and honey (if using) in a blender.
2. Blend the ingredients until smooth and well combined.
3. Taste the mixture and adjust sweetness by adding more honey if desired.
4. Pour the mixture into popsicle molds, leaving a little space at the top for expansion.
5. Insert popsicle sticks into each mold.
6. Place the molds in the freezer and let them freeze for at least 4-6 hours, or until solid.
7. Once fully frozen, remove the popsicles from the molds by running them under warm water for a few seconds.
8. Serve immediately and enjoy these refreshing Watermelon Mint Popsicles on a hot day!

Note: If you prefer a smoother texture without any watermelon pulp, you can strain the mixture after blending for a smoother popsicle.
