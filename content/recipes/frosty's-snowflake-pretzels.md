## Frosty's Snowflake Pretzels

### Ingredients:

- 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast
- 1 cup warm water
- 2 tablespoons baking soda
- Coarse sea salt, for sprinkling
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- Optional toppings: colored sugar, sprinkles, crushed candy canes

### Instructions:

1. Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, and sugar.

3. In a separate bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water and let it sit for about 5 minutes until frothy.

4. Slowly pour the yeast mixture into the dry ingredients, stirring continuously until the dough comes together.

5. Transfer the dough to a clean, floured surface and knead for about 5 minutes until smooth and elastic.

6. Divide the dough into small portions and roll each piece into a long, thin rope.

7. Shape the dough ropes into snowflake shapes by crossing two ends over each other and repeating to form six points.

8. In a separate bowl, dissolve the baking soda in 4 cups of boiling water.

9. Carefully dip each snowflake pretzel into the boiling water mixture for about 30 seconds, then remove and place them on the prepared baking sheet.

10. Sprinkle each pretzel with coarse sea salt and any desired toppings, such as colored sugar, sprinkles, or crushed candy canes.

11. Bake the pretzels in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until they turn golden brown.

12. Remove the pretzels from the oven and brush with melted butter while they are still warm.

13. Allow the pretzels to cool slightly before serving. Enjoy Frosty's Snowflake Pretzels as a delightful holiday treat!
