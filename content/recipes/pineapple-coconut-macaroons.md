These Pineapple Coconut Macaroons are a tropical twist on the classic sweet treat. The combination of pineapple and coconut adds a burst of flavor to these chewy and moist macaroons. Enjoy them as a delightful dessert or as a snack any time of the day.

**Ingredients:**
- 2 cups shredded coconut
- 1 cup canned crushed pineapple, drained
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 large egg whites
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Pinch of salt

**Instructions:**
1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone mat.
2. In a large bowl, combine the shredded coconut, crushed pineapple, sugar, flour, vanilla extract, and salt. Mix until all the ingredients are well combined.
3. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. This might take a few minutes.
4. Gently fold the beaten egg whites into the coconut-pineapple mixture. Make sure not to overmix; you want to maintain the lightness of the egg whites.
5. Using a cookie scoop or a tablespoon, drop rounded mounds of the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.
6. Bake for 15-18 minutes, or until the macaroons turn golden brown on top.
7. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and allow the macaroons to cool for a few minutes on the sheet before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
8. Once cooled, serve the Pineapple Coconut Macaroons and enjoy their tropical goodness!

**Note:** If desired, you can dip the bottoms of the macaroons into melted chocolate for an extra indulgence. Let the chocolate harden before serving.

Happy baking!
