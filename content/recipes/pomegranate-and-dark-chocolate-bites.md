# Pomegranate and Dark Chocolate Bites Recipe

## Ingredients:

- 2 large pomegranates
- 8-10 ounces of high-quality dark chocolate, chopped
- Optional toppings: chopped nuts, shredded coconut, sea salt 

## Instructions:

1. Cut the pomegranates in half, and gently scoop out the seeds into a bowl. Make sure to remove any pith or white membrane.

2. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

3. Melt the dark chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pot of simmering water. Stir continuously until smooth and fully melted. Remove from heat.

4. Using a spoon or fork, dip each pomegranate seed into the melted chocolate, allowing any excess chocolate to drip off. Place the chocolate-coated seed onto the prepared baking sheet.

5. Repeat the process for all pomegranate seeds until they are all coated in chocolate. 

6. Sprinkle optional toppings such as chopped nuts, shredded coconut, or sea salt over the top of each chocolate-coated seed.

7. Place the baking sheet in the refrigerator for about 20-30 minutes or until the chocolate hardens.

8. Once the chocolate has hardened, carefully remove the pomegranate and dark chocolate bites from the baking sheet and transfer them to a serving dish.

9. Serve and enjoy!

Tip: Store any leftover pomegranate and dark chocolate bites in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
