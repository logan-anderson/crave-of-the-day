## Chocolate-Dipped Orange Peels Recipe

### Ingredients:
- 2 large oranges
- 1 cup water
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 8 oz dark chocolate, chopped
- Optional: sprinkle of sea salt or chopped nuts for topping

### Instructions:
1. Wash the oranges thoroughly to remove any dirt or wax. Use a vegetable peeler to carefully remove the orange peel in long strips. Try to avoid getting too much of the white pith, as it can be bitter.
2. Cut the orange peels into thin strips, around 1/4 inch wide.
3. In a saucepan, combine the water and sugar. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves completely.
4. Reduce the heat to low and add the orange peel strips to the saucepan. Allow them to simmer in the syrup for about 45 minutes, until they become soft and translucent.
5. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the orange peels to a wire rack and let them cool for 5-10 minutes.
6. In the meantime, melt the chopped dark chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl by heating it in 30-second intervals, stirring well in between, until smooth and fully melted.
7. Dip each cooled orange peel strip into the melted chocolate, making sure to coat it completely. Allow any excess chocolate to drip off before placing the dipped peel back on the wire rack.
8. If desired, sprinkle a pinch of sea salt or chopped nuts on top of the chocolate-dipped orange peel for added flavor and texture.
9. Repeat the dipping process with all the orange peel strips.
10. Once all the orange peels are dipped, place the wire rack in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes, or until the chocolate sets and becomes firm.
11. Once the chocolate has hardened, remove the chocolate-dipped orange peels from the refrigerator. Store them in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.
