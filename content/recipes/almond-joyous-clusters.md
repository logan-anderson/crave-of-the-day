## Almond Joyous Clusters

### Ingredients:
- 2 cups shredded coconut
- 1/2 cup sliced almonds
- 1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup dark chocolate chips
- 1/4 cup whole almonds, for topping

### Instructions:
1. Preheat your oven to 325°F (165°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a mixing bowl, combine the shredded coconut, sliced almonds, sweetened condensed milk, and vanilla extract. Stir the ingredients until well combined.
3. Using a tablespoon or a small ice cream scoop, drop clusters of the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving some space in between.
4. Gently press a whole almond on top of each cluster.
5. Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for about 12-15 minutes, or until the clusters turn golden brown.
6. Remove the clusters from the oven and let them cool completely on the baking sheet.
7. In a microwave-safe bowl, melt the dark chocolate chips in 30-second intervals, stirring between each interval until smooth and fully melted.
8. Drizzle the melted chocolate over the cooled clusters, using a spoon or a pastry bag with a small tip.
9. Allow the chocolate to set for about 30 minutes at room temperature, or place the clusters in the refrigerator for faster setting.
10. Once the chocolate has hardened, transfer the clusters to an airtight container for storage.
11. Enjoy your delicious homemade Almond Joyous Clusters!
