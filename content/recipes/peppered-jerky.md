# Peppered Jerky Recipe

## Ingredients:
- 2 pounds of lean beef, thinly sliced
- 1 cup of soy sauce
- 1/4 cup of Worcestershire sauce
- 1/4 cup of liquid smoke
- 2 tablespoons of brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon of black pepper
- 1 tablespoon of onion powder
- 1 tablespoon of garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes (adjust to taste)
- 1 teaspoon of curing salt (optional)

## Instructions:
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, liquid smoke, brown sugar, black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, and curing salt. Stir well until the sugar dissolves and the spices are evenly distributed.

2. Add the thinly sliced beef to the marinade mixture, ensuring all pieces are coated. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or overnight for the best flavor.

3. Preheat your oven to 175°F (80°C) or the lowest temperature available. Alternatively, you can use a food dehydrator or smoker for drying the jerky.

4. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and place a wire rack on top. Arrange the marinated beef slices on the wire rack, leaving some space between each piece for air circulation.

5. Sprinkle additional black pepper on top of the beef slices to create a peppery coating. Press the pepper gently to ensure it sticks to the meat.

6. Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven or smoker and allow the jerky to dry for 4-6 hours. Check the jerky occasionally and rotate the rack if needed for even drying. If using a dehydrator, follow the manufacturer's instructions.

7. Remove a small piece of jerky and let it cool. Check the texture to determine if it's dry and chewy. If needed, continue drying for another hour or until you achieve the desired consistency.

8. Once the jerky is fully dried, remove it from the oven and let it cool completely. Pat the jerky slices with a paper towel to remove any excess oil or moisture. Store the jerky in an airtight container or ziplock bags for up to 2 weeks.

Enjoy your homemade peppered jerky as a delicious and protein-packed snack!
