## Toffee Apple Crisps

### Ingredients:
- 4 medium-sized apples (Granny Smith or Gala)
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1/4 cup water
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Cinnamon sugar, for dusting

### Instructions:
1. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
2. Wash and dry the apples, then cut them into thin slices, about 1/4 inch thick. Remove the core and seeds.
3. In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar, water, butter, and salt. Heat over medium heat until the sugar dissolves and the mixture comes to a boil.
4. Stir in the vanilla extract and continue boiling the mixture, without stirring, until it reaches a light amber color, about 7-10 minutes. Watch it carefully to avoid burning.
5. Remove the toffee mixture from the heat and let it cool slightly for a minute or two.
6. Take each apple slice and coat it in the toffee mixture, making sure all sides are evenly covered. Allow any excess to drip off before placing the coated apple slice on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining apple slices.
7. Sprinkle cinnamon sugar over the coated apple slices while the toffee is still warm.
8. Allow the toffee apple crisps to cool and harden completely at room temperature. This usually takes about an hour.
9. Once cooled and hardened, carefully remove the toffee apple crisps from the parchment paper.
10. Serve and enjoy these crunchy, sweet, and tangy Toffee Apple Crisps! They can be stored in an airtight container for up to 3 days.

**Note:** Be cautious when working with the toffee mixture as it can get very hot. Ensure the toffee has cooled enough to handle before coating the apple slices.
