## Ingredients

- 2 cups old-fashioned oats
- 1 cup chopped nuts (such as almonds or pecans)
- 1/2 cup dried cranberries
- 1/2 cup pumpkin seeds
- 1/4 cup shredded coconut (unsweetened)
- 1/4 cup honey
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted
- 1/4 cup brown sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips
- Candy eyeballs, for decoration (optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 350Â°F (175Â°C). Lightly grease a baking dish or line it with parchment paper.

2. In a large bowl, combine the oats, chopped nuts, dried cranberries, pumpkin seeds, and shredded coconut. Mix well.

3. In a separate microwave-safe bowl, heat the honey, melted butter, brown sugar, vanilla extract, ground cinnamon, and salt on high for 30 seconds. Stir until the mixture is smooth and well combined.

4. Pour the honey mixture over the dry ingredients in the large bowl. Stir until all the dry ingredients are evenly coated.

5. Gently fold in the mini chocolate chips, making sure they are evenly distributed throughout the mixture.

6. Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking dish, pressing it down firmly and evenly using the back of a spoon or your hands. Make sure it's tightly packed to prevent crumbling.

7. Bake in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes or until the edges turn golden brown.

8. Remove from the oven and let it cool completely in the dish. This allows the granola bars to set properly.

9. Once cooled, use a sharp knife to cut the granola into desired bar-sized pieces. For extra ghoulish fun, press candy eyeballs into the bars to give them a spooky appearance.

10. Store the Ghoulish Granola Bars in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week. Enjoy your creepy and delightful snack whenever you need a quick energy boost!

Happy Halloween snacking! ðŸ‘»ðŸŽƒ
