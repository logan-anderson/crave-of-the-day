## Vampire Velvet Cupcakes

### Ingredients:

For the cupcakes:
- 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup buttermilk
- 1/2 cup red food coloring (or desired amount for bloody effect)

For the cream cheese frosting:
- 8 ounces cream cheese, softened
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 4 cups powdered sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

For the decoration:
- 24 small chocolate vampire teeth candies
- Red gel food coloring

### Instructions:

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a cupcake pan with paper liners.

2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.

3. In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.

4. Gradually add the dry ingredient mixture to the creamed mixture, alternating with the buttermilk. Begin and end with the dry ingredients, mixing just until combined.

5. Stir in the red food coloring until the batter is evenly colored and achieve the desired bloody effect.

6. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared cupcake liners, filling each about 2/3 full.

7. Bake in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Transfer the cupcakes to a wire rack and let them cool completely.

8. While the cupcakes are cooling, prepare the cream cheese frosting. In a large bowl, beat together the softened cream cheese and butter until smooth and creamy. Gradually add the powdered sugar, one cup at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.

9. Once the cupcakes have cooled, frost them generously with the cream cheese frosting, creating a smooth or swirled pattern on top.

10. Decorate each cupcake by placing a small chocolate vampire teeth candy on top of the frosting, gently pressing them in. For a bloody effect, use a toothpick dipped in red gel food coloring to create "blood" drips on the teeth or around the frosting.

11. Serve and enjoy these spooktacular Vampire Velvet Cupcakes!
