# Choco-Mint Cookie Stacks

**Ingredients:**
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1 cup packed brown sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon peppermint extract
- 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
- 1 cup crushed peppermint candy canes

**Instructions:**

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.

3. In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.

4. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla and peppermint extracts.

5. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Do not overmix.

6. Fold in the chocolate chips, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.

7. Scoop tablespoonfuls of the dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.

8. Gently flatten each dough ball with the bottom of a glass or your hand, creating a disc shape.

9. Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are set and the centers are slightly soft.

10. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and allow the cookies to cool on the sheet for 5 minutes. Then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.

11. Once the cookies have cooled, take one cookie and spread a layer of crushed peppermint candy canes onto the bottom surface. 

12. Place another cookie on top of the candy canes, creating a stack, and press down gently to secure them together.

13. Repeat this process with the remaining cookies and crushed candy canes.

14. Serve the delicious Choco-Mint Cookie Stacks and enjoy!

Note: You can store the cookie stacks in an airtight container for up to 1 week.
