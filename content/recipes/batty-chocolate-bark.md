## Batty Chocolate Bark Recipe

### Ingredients:
- 8 ounces dark chocolate, chopped
- 1/4 cup dried cranberries
- 1/4 cup roasted almonds, roughly chopped
- 1/4 cup pumpkin seeds
- 1/4 cup shredded toasted coconut
- 1/4 cup white chocolate, melted
- Bat-shaped cookie cutter (optional)

### Instructions:
1. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking mat.
2. Melt the dark chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water, stirring until smooth.
3. Pour the melted chocolate onto the prepared baking sheet and spread it into an even layer using a spatula.
4. Sprinkle the dried cranberries, roasted almonds, pumpkin seeds, and shredded toasted coconut evenly over the melted chocolate.
5. Drizzle the melted white chocolate over the toppings.
6. Use a toothpick or skewer to drag the white chocolate through the dark chocolate to create a marbled effect.
7. If desired, use a bat-shaped cookie cutter to gently press into the chocolate before it sets, creating bat-shaped pieces.
8. Place the baking sheet in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes, or until the chocolate is set.
9. Once set, break the bark into large pieces using your hands or a knife.
10. Serve and enjoy!

Tip: Store the Batty Chocolate Bark in an airtight container in a cool place for up to 2 weeks.
