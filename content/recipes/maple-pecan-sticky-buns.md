## Recipe: Maple Pecan Sticky Buns

### Ingredients:
- For the dough:
  - 2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
  - 1/4 cup granulated sugar
  - 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast
  - 1/2 teaspoon salt
  - 1/2 cup milk, warmed
  - 1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted
  - 2 large eggs

- For the filling:
  - 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
  - 1/2 cup packed brown sugar
  - 1/4 cup maple syrup
  - 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
  - 1 cup chopped pecans

- For the caramel glaze:
  - 1/2 cup packed brown sugar
  - 1/4 cup unsalted butter
  - 1/4 cup maple syrup
  - 1/4 cup heavy cream
  - 1/2 cup chopped pecans (optional, for topping)

### Instructions:
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, granulated sugar, yeast, and salt.

2. In a separate bowl, whisk together the warm milk, melted butter, and eggs.

3. Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients and stir until a dough forms.

4. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic.

5. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for approximately 1 hour, or until it doubles in size.

6. While the dough is rising, prepare the filling. In a small bowl, mix together the softened butter, brown sugar, maple syrup, and ground cinnamon until well combined.

7. Once the dough has doubled in size, punch it down and roll it out into a rectangle, approximately 12x18 inches.

8. Spread the filling mixture evenly over the dough, making sure to reach the edges. Sprinkle the chopped pecans on top.

9. Starting from the long side, tightly roll up the dough into a log. Cut the log into 12 equal slices.

10. Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Place the slices cut-side down in the dish, leaving a little space between each bun.

11. Cover the dish with the kitchen towel again and let it rise for an additional 30 minutes.

12. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). 

13. Once the buns have risen, prepare the caramel glaze. In a saucepan, combine the brown sugar, butter, maple syrup, and heavy cream. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until the mixture comes to a boil. Remove from heat.

14. Pour the caramel glaze over the risen buns in the baking dish, making sure to coat each bun evenly. If desired, sprinkle additional chopped pecans on top.

15. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes until golden brown and sticky.

16. Remove the sticky buns from the oven and allow them to cool for a few minutes before serving. They are best served warm.
