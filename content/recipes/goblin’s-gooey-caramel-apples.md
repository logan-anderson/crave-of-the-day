## Recipe: Goblin's Gooey Caramel Apples

### Ingredients
- 6 Granny Smith apples
- 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1/4 cup light corn syrup
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Optional garnishes:
  - Chopped nuts (e.g., peanuts, almonds)
  - Sprinkles
  - Chocolate chips

### Instructions
1. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set it aside.
2. Rinse the apples under cold water to remove any wax. Dry them thoroughly and remove the stems. Insert a wooden stick into the top of each apple where the stem was.
3. Place the granulated sugar, unsalted butter, heavy cream, and light corn syrup in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir until the butter is melted and the mixture is smooth. 
4. Once the mixture starts to boil, reduce the heat to low and cook for approximately 20 minutes, or until the caramel becomes thick and dark amber in color. Stir occasionally to prevent burning.
5. Remove the caramel from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Allow it to cool slightly for a few minutes.
6. Dip each apple into the caramel, rotating it to ensure even coating. Let the excess caramel drip back into the saucepan.
7. If desired, roll the caramel-coated apple in chopped nuts, sprinkles, or chocolate chips while the caramel is still warm.
8. Place the coated apples on the prepared baking sheet and allow them to cool completely at room temperature.
9. If desired, refrigerate the caramel apples for 1-2 hours to speed up the setting process.
10. Serve and enjoy the Goblin's Gooey Caramel Apples!
