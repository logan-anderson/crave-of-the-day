## Werewolf Wontons

These delicious Werewolf Wontons are perfect for Halloween parties or any spooky gathering. Filled with a flavorful mix of meat and spices, these crispy appetizers are sure to be a howling success!

**Ingredients:**
- 1 pound ground beef
- 1/2 cup finely chopped mushrooms
- 1/4 cup finely chopped water chestnuts
- 2 green onions, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons hoisin sauce
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 24 wonton wrappers
- Vegetable oil, for frying
- Toothpicks

**Instructions:**
1. In a large bowl, combine ground beef, mushrooms, water chestnuts, green onions, and garlic. Mix well to evenly distribute the ingredients.
2. In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, hoisin sauce, sesame oil, and black pepper. Pour the sauce over the beef mixture and mix until well combined.
3. Take one wonton wrapper and place a small spoonful of the beef filling in the center. Wet your finger with water and run it along the edges of the wrapper to moisten. Fold the wrapper in half diagonally to create a triangle and press the edges firmly to seal. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling.
4. In a large skillet or deep fryer, heat vegetable oil to 350¬∞F (175¬∞C). Carefully add the wontons in batches and fry for about 2-3 minutes per side, until golden brown and crispy. Remove from the oil and place on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.
5. Once the wontons have cooled slightly, insert a toothpick into each one to resemble werewolf fangs. Serve them with a spooky dipping sauce of your choice.
6. Enjoy these delicious Werewolf Wontons as a fun and scary appetizer at your next Halloween party!
