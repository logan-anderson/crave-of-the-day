## Honey Roasted Almonds

### Ingredients:
- 2 cups of raw almonds
- 3 tablespoons of honey
- 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil
- 1/2 teaspoon of salt
- 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon (optional)

### Instructions:
1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a mixing bowl, combine the honey, vegetable oil, salt, and cinnamon (if desired).
3. Add the almonds to the bowl and toss them until they are well coated with the honey mixture.
4. Spread the coated almonds evenly on the prepared baking sheet.
5. Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and roast the almonds for about 12-15 minutes, stirring once or twice during baking.
6. Keep a close eye on the almonds to prevent them from burning. They should turn golden brown and become fragrant when they are done.
7. Once roasted, remove the almonds from the oven and let them cool completely on the baking sheet.
8. Once cooled, transfer the honey roasted almonds to an airtight container for storage. Enjoy as a tasty snack or use them in your favorite recipes!

Note: You can adjust the amount of honey and salt according to your taste preferences.
