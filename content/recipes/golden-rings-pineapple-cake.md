- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

2. In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.
3. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.
4. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add this dry mixture to the creamed butter and sugar, alternating with the crushed pineapple. Start and finish with the dry ingredients.
5. Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan, spreading it evenly.
6. Arrange pineapple rings on top of the batter, placing maraschino cherries in the centers of the rings.
