Here's a recipe for Spicy Chocolate Churros:

## **Ingredients:**
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup water
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (adjust to taste)
- Vegetable oil, for frying

**For the Spicy Chocolate Sauce:**
- 4 oz dark chocolate, chopped
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 2 tablespoons powdered sugar

## **Instructions:**

1. In a medium saucepan, combine water, butter, sugar, salt, cinnamon, and cayenne pepper. Heat over medium heat until the mixture comes to a boil.
2. Reduce heat to low and add the flour to the saucepan, stirring vigorously with a wooden spoon until the dough comes together and forms a ball. Continue to stir for an additional 1-2 minutes to cook the flour.
3. Remove the saucepan from heat and let the dough cool for a few minutes.
4. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet or pot to a temperature of 350°F (175°C).
5. Spoon the churro dough into a piping bag fitted with a star tip.
6. Pipe 4-6 inch long churros into the hot oil, cutting them with scissors. Fry until golden brown and crispy, about 3-4 minutes, turning occasionally.
7. Remove the churros from the oil and drain on a paper towel-lined plate.
8. In a small saucepan, combine heavy cream, chocolate, cinnamon, cayenne pepper, and powdered sugar for the spicy chocolate sauce. Heat over low heat, stirring constantly, until the chocolate has melted and the sauce is smooth.
9. Serve the churros warm, sprinkled with powdered sugar, and with the spicy chocolate sauce on the side for dipping.
10. Enjoy these spicy chocolate churros as a deliciously unique dessert!

Note: Be cautious while working with hot oil and melted chocolate.
