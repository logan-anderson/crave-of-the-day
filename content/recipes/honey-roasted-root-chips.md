## Honey Roasted Root Chips

### Ingredients:
- 2 large beets
- 2 large carrots
- 2 large parsnips
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 1 teaspoon sea salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- Optional: fresh herbs for garnish (e.g., thyme or rosemary)

### Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Peel the beets, carrots, and parsnips. Using a sharp knife or a mandoline slicer, thinly slice the vegetables into uniform chips.
3. In a large bowl, toss the sliced vegetables with olive oil, honey, sea salt, and black pepper until evenly coated.
4. Spread the vegetable chips in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.
5. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the chips are crispy and golden brown, flipping them halfway through the baking time to ensure even roasting.
6. Remove from the oven and let the chips cool slightly before transferring to a serving plate. Garnish with fresh herbs if desired.
7. Serve the honey roasted root chips immediately as a delicious and healthy snack or as a side dish to complement your favorite meal.
