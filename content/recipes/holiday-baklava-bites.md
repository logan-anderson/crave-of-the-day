**Ingredients:**

For the Baklava:
- 1 package of filo pastry sheets (about 16 ounces)
- 1 cup unsalted butter, melted
- 2 cups mixed nuts (e.g., walnuts, almonds, pistachios), roughly chopped
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon ground cloves

For the Syrup:
- 1 cup water
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1 cup honey
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice

**Instructions:**

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C) and grease a baking dish or muffin tin.

2. In a mixing bowl, combine the chopped nuts, sugar, cinnamon, and cloves. Mix well and set aside.

3. Unroll the filo pastry sheets and cut them into squares or rectangles, approximately the size of your muffin tin.

4. Take one pastry sheet and brush it generously with melted butter. Layer another pastry sheet on top and repeat the process until you have 6 layers.

5. Once you have 6 layers, cut the pastry into smaller squares or rectangles that will fit into your muffin tin. Repeat this process to make as many baklava bites as desired.

6. Place each layered pastry square into the wells of the muffin tin, pressing them gently to create a cup shape. Fill each pastry cup with the nut mixture, ensuring they are evenly distributed.

7. Bake the baklava bites in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the pastry turns golden brown and crisp.

8. While the baklava bites are baking, prepare the syrup. In a saucepan, combine the water, sugar, honey, cinnamon stick, and lemon juice. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for about 10 minutes until the syrup thickens slightly. Remove from heat and let it cool.

9. Once the baklava bites are done, remove them from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes. Drizzle the prepared syrup over the baklava bites, ensuring they are evenly coated.

10. Allow the baklava bites to soak in the syrup for at least 1 hour before serving, preferably overnight. This will enhance the flavors and make them even more delicious.

11. Serve the Holiday Baklava Bites as a festive dessert or snack, garnished with a sprinkle of finely chopped nuts if desired.

Enjoy these decadent Holiday Baklava Bites with your family and friends, and have a joyous celebration!
