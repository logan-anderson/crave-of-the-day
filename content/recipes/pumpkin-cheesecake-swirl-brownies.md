# Pumpkin Cheesecake Swirl Brownies Recipe

## Ingredients:
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup pumpkin puree
- 4 ounces cream cheese, softened
- 1/4 cup powdered sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice

## Instructions:

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and line a 9x9-inch baking pan with parchment paper, leaving some overhang for easy removal.

2. In a large bowl, whisk together the melted butter and granulated sugar until well combined.

3. Add the eggs and vanilla extract to the bowl and mix until incorporated.

4. In a separate mixing bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, and salt. Gradually add these dry ingredients to the butter-sugar mixture, stirring until just combined. Do not overmix.

5. Pour the brownie batter into the prepared baking pan, and spread it evenly.

6. In another bowl, combine the softened cream cheese, powdered sugar, pumpkin puree, and pumpkin pie spice. Mix until smooth and well blended.

7. Drop spoonfuls of the pumpkin cheesecake mixture onto the brownie batter in the pan. Use a knife or toothpick to swirl the pumpkin mixture into the brownie batter, creating a marbled pattern.

8. Place the pan in the preheated oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs.

9. Remove the pan from the oven and let it cool completely in the pan on a wire rack.

10. Once cooled, use the parchment paper to lift the brownies out of the pan. Cut into squares and serve.

Enjoy these delicious, moist Pumpkin Cheesecake Swirl Brownies!
