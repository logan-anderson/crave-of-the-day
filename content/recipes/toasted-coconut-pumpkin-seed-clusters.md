# Toasted Coconut Pumpkin Seed Clusters

### Ingredients:
- 1 cup pumpkin seeds, raw and unsalted
- 1 cup shredded coconut, unsweetened
- 1/4 cup honey
- 1 tablespoon coconut oil
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

### Instructions:
1. Preheat your oven to 325°F (160°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a medium-sized bowl, combine the pumpkin seeds and shredded coconut.
3. In a small saucepan over low heat, melt the coconut oil. Add the honey, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and salt to the saucepan. Stir until well combined and warmed through.
4. Pour the warm honey mixture over the pumpkin seed and coconut mixture. Stir until all the ingredients are evenly coated.
5. Spread the mixture evenly onto the prepared baking sheet.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for about 15 minutes, or until the coconut starts to turn golden brown. Be sure to stir the mixture every 5 minutes to ensure even toasting.
7. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and let the clusters cool completely. They will harden as they cool.
8. Once cooled, break the clusters into smaller pieces if desired.
9. Serve as a delicious, crunchy snack or as a topping for yogurt, salads, or desserts. Enjoy!
