# Mince Pie Pastry Twists

## Ingredients:
- 2 sheets of ready-made puff pastry
- 1 cup of mincemeat 
- 1 egg, beaten
- 1 tablespoon of caster sugar
- 1 tablespoon of milk
- Icing sugar, for dusting (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
2. Roll out both sheets of puff pastry onto a lightly floured surface.
3. Spread the mincemeat evenly over one pastry sheet, leaving a small border around the edges.
4. Carefully place the other pastry sheet on top of the mincemeat-covered sheet.
5. Gently press down to seal the two pastry sheets together.
6. Using a sharp knife, cut the pastry layers into strips, around 1.5cm (0.5 inch) wide.
7. Take each strip and twist it a few times before placing it onto the prepared baking sheet.
8. Repeat with the remaining pastry strips, leaving some space between each twist.
9. In a small bowl, mix the beaten egg and milk together.
10. Lightly brush the pastry twists with the egg and milk mixture.
11. Sprinkle caster sugar evenly over the twists.
12. Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the twists are golden brown and puffed up.
13. Once baked, remove from the oven and let cool on a wire rack.
14. Serve the mince pie pastry twists warm or at room temperature.
15. Optionally, dust with icing sugar before serving for an added touch.
