## Recipe: Hazelnut Cacao Spread on Whole Grain Crackers

### Ingredients:
- 1 cup roasted hazelnuts
- 1/4 cup cacao powder
- 1/4 cup maple syrup
- 1/4 cup coconut oil, melted
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Pinch of salt
- Whole grain crackers, for serving

### Instructions:
1. Place the roasted hazelnuts in a food processor or high-speed blender. Process until they form a smooth hazelnut butter consistency, for about 5-7 minutes.
2. Add the cacao powder, maple syrup, melted coconut oil, vanilla extract, and salt to the hazelnut butter. Process again until all the ingredients are well combined and the spread becomes smooth and creamy.
3. Transfer the Hazelnut Cacao Spread into a clean jar or airtight container.
