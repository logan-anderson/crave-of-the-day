# Maple Bacon Jerky

## Ingredients
- 1 pound bacon
- 1/4 cup maple syrup
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- Optional: pinch of cayenne pepper for some heat

## Instructions
1. Preheat your oven to 175°F (80°C) and line a baking sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper.
2. In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the maple syrup, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, black pepper, and cayenne pepper (if using).
3. Take the bacon and slice it into thin strips, around 1/4 inch wide. Remove any excess fat if desired.
4. Dip each bacon strip into the maple syrup mixture, making sure to coat both sides evenly. Let the excess marinade drip off.
5. Place the marinated bacon strips on the prepared baking sheet, ensuring they do not overlap.
6. Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and allow the bacon to cook for 2 to 3 hours, or until it reaches the desired level of crispiness. Turn the bacon strips halfway through the cooking time to ensure even cooking.
7. Once the bacon jerky is cooked, remove it from the oven and let it cool completely. As it cools, it will become even crispier.
8. Once cooled, transfer the Maple Bacon Jerky to an airtight container or sealable plastic bag for storage. It can be stored at room temperature for up to 2 weeks.
