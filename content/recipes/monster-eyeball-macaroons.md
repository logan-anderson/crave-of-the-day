### Ingredients
- 2 cups shredded coconut
- 1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Pinch of salt
- 12 small chocolate candies (for the pupils)
- 12 large red gumdrops (for the bloodshot effect)
- Optional: food coloring (green, blue, or any other monster color of your choice)

### Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 325°F (163°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a mixing bowl, combine the shredded coconut, sweetened condensed milk, vanilla extract, and salt. Stir well until all ingredients are evenly combined.
3. If desired, add a few drops of food coloring to the mixture and stir until the color is distributed evenly.
4. Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, portion out 12 evenly-sized mounds of the macaroon mixture onto the prepared baking sheet.
5. Using your thumb, create an indentation in the center of each macaroon mound to form the eyeball shape.
6. Place a small chocolate candy in the center of each indentation to create the pupil of the eye.
7. Flatten a red gumdrop between your fingers and press it gently around the "eye" to create a bloodshot effect. Repeat for each macaroon.
8. Bake the macaroons in the preheated oven for 15-18 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.
9. Remove from the oven and allow the macaroons to cool completely on a wire rack before serving.

Enjoy these spooky and delicious Monster Eyeball Macaroons as a spooky treat for Halloween or any monster-themed party!
