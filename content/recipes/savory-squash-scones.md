**Ingredients:**
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon paprika
- 1/4 cup cold unsalted butter, cubed
- 1 cup cooked and mashed squash (butternut or acorn squash work well)
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1/4 cup milk (plus extra for brushing)
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley (optional, for garnish)

**Instructions:**
1. Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, dried thyme, dried rosemary, black pepper, and paprika.
3. Add the cold cubed butter to the bowl and use a pastry cutter or your fingertips to rub the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs.
4. Stir in the mashed squash and grated Parmesan cheese, followed by the milk. Mix until just combined, being careful not to overmix.
5. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead it a few times to bring it together. Pat it into a rectangle about 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick.
6. Using a sharp knife, cut the dough into 8 triangles or use a round cookie cutter to make traditional scone shapes.
7. Transfer the scones to the prepared baking sheet, leaving a couple of inches between them.
8. Brush the tops of the scones with a little milk to give them a nice golden color when baked.
9. Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the scones have risen and turned golden brown.
10. Remove from the oven and let the scones cool for a few minutes on the baking sheet.
11. Serve warm with butter and garnish with fresh parsley if desired.

Enjoy these flavorful savory squash scones as a delightful addition to your next meal!
