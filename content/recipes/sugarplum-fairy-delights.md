## Ingredients

- 1 cup dried plums (prunes)
- 1 cup mixed nuts (such as almonds, walnuts, and pistachios)
- 1/2 cup dried apricots

## Instructions

1. In a food processor, combine the dried plums, mixed nuts, dried apricots, and dried cherries. Pulse until they are finely chopped and well combined.

2. In a small saucepan, warm the honey over low heat until it becomes thin and runny. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract, ground cinnamon, ground nutmeg, and ground allspice. Mix well.
