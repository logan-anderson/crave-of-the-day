Here's a recipe for Dried Fruit and Nut Bars:

## Ingredients:
- 1 1/2 cups of mixed dried fruits (such as apricots, cherries, raisins, cranberries)
- 3/4 cup of mixed nuts (such as almonds, cashews, pistachios)
- 1/2 cup of old-fashioned rolled oats
- 1/4 cup of honey or maple syrup
- 1/4 cup of almond butter or peanut butter
- 1/4 cup of unsweetened shredded coconut
- 1/4 cup of dark chocolate chips (optional)
- 1 tablespoon of chia seeds (optional)
- Pinch of salt

## Instructions:
1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking dish with parchment paper and set it aside.
2. In a large mixing bowl, roughly chop the mixed dried fruits and mixed nuts into small pieces. Leave some larger pieces for texture.
3. Add the oats, honey or maple syrup, almond butter or peanut butter, shredded coconut, dark chocolate chips (if desired), chia seeds (if desired), and a pinch of salt to the bowl with the dried fruits and nuts.
4. Stir all the ingredients together until well combined and the mixture starts to come together.
5. Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking dish and press it down firmly and evenly with the back of a spoon or your hands.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes or until the edges turn golden brown.
7. Remove from the oven and let it cool completely in the baking dish before cutting into bars or squares.
8. Once cool, store the dried fruit and nut bars in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week or refrigerate for longer shelf life.
