# Butternut Squash Soup Poppers

## Ingredients:
- 1 small butternut squash
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 small onion, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 cup vegetable broth
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 1 cup bread crumbs
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- Fresh parsley, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
2. Cut the butternut squash in half lengthwise and scoop out the seeds. Place the squash halves cut side up on a baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Roast in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes, or until the squash is tender when pierced with a fork. 
3. Remove the squash from the oven and let it cool slightly. Once cool enough to handle, scoop out the flesh of the squash and set aside.
4. In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onion and minced garlic, cooking until the onion is translucent and fragrant.
5. Add the cumin, paprika, salt, and black pepper to the pot, stirring well to coat the onions and garlic with the spices. Cook for an additional minute.
6. Add the roasted butternut squash flesh to the pot, along with the vegetable broth. Stir until well combined. Bring the mixture to a simmer and let it cook for 10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.
7. Using an immersion blender or a regular blender, puree the soup until smooth.
8. Return the soup to the pot and stir in the heavy cream. Heat over low heat until warm.
9. In a separate bowl, combine the bread crumbs and grated Parmesan cheese.
10. Shape the butternut squash soup mixture into small balls, about 1 inch in diameter. Roll each ball in the bread crumb mixture, coating evenly.
11. Place the coated poppers on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
12. Bake in the preheated oven for about 15 minutes, or until the poppers are golden brown and crispy.
13. Garnish with fresh parsley and serve hot.
