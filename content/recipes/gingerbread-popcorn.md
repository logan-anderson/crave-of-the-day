Here's a recipe for Gingerbread Popcorn:

**Ingredients:**
- 8 cups popcorn, popped (about ½ cup unpopped kernels)
- ½ cup unsalted butter
- ¾ cup brown sugar, packed
- ¼ cup light corn syrup
- 2 tablespoons molasses
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ¼ teaspoon ground cloves
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt

**Instructions:**
1. Preheat your oven to 250°F (120°C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
2. Place the popped popcorn in a large bowl and set aside.
3. In a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter.
4. Add the brown sugar, corn syrup, molasses, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves to the saucepan. Stir well until the mixture is fully combined and begins to boil.
5. Allow the mixture to boil for 4 minutes without stirring. Remove the saucepan from the heat.
6. Stir in the vanilla extract, baking soda, and salt until well combined. The mixture will become frothy.
7. Pour the gingerbread mixture over the popcorn in the bowl. Use a rubber spatula or wooden spoon to gently toss the popcorn until it is evenly coated with the gingerbread mixture.
8. Transfer the popcorn to the prepared baking sheet and spread it out evenly.
9. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, stirring every 15 minutes to prevent burning and ensure even coating.
10. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and allow the gingerbread popcorn to cool completely.
11. Once cooled, break apart any large clumps and transfer the gingerbread popcorn to an airtight container for storage.
12. Serve and enjoy!

Note: The gingerbread popcorn can be stored in an airtight container for up to one week.
