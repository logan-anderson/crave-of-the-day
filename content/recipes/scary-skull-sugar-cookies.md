Preparation Time: 1 hour
Cooking Time: 10-12 minutes
Yields: 15-20 cookies

## Ingredients

- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 3/4 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Skull-shaped cookie cutter
- Black gel food coloring
- Red gel food coloring
- White royal icing

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).

2. In a medium-sized mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.

3. In a separate large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy, using an electric mixer.

4. Beat in the egg and vanilla extract until fully incorporated.

5. Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until combined. The dough will be slightly sticky but should hold together.

6. Divide the dough in half, wrap each half in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.

7. Lightly flour a clean surface and roll out one portion of the dough to approximately 1/4 inch thickness.

8. Use the skull-shaped cookie cutter to cut out skull shapes from the rolled dough. Place the cutouts onto a parchment-lined baking sheet, leaving some space in between.

9. Repeat the rolling and cutting process with the remaining dough until all the dough is used.

10. Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges start to turn golden. Remove from the oven and let them cool completely on a wire rack.

11. Once the cookies are cooled, it's time to decorate. Divide the white royal icing into three bowls. Leave one bowl of icing white, dye another bowl of icing black using the gel food coloring, and dye the third bowl of icing red.

12. Fill three separate pastry bags with each color of icing, fitted with small round piping tips.

13. Pipe the white icing onto the cookies to create the skull shape outline. Allow it to dry for a few minutes.

14. Next, pipe black icing onto the cookies to fill in the eye sockets, nose cavity, and the outline of the mouth. Be creative with the facial expressions!

15. Finish by using the red icing to pipe the outline of blood dripping from the mouth or use it to add any other scary details you desire.

16. Let the icing set completely before serving your spooky skull sugar cookies.

Enjoy these deliciously scary treats at your Halloween party or any time you want to add some spookiness to your day!
