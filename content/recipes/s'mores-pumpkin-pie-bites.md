# S'mores Pumpkin Pie Bites

## Ingredients:
- 1 package pre-made pie crusts (2 crusts)
- 1 cup canned pumpkin puree
- 1/2 cup packed brown sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 eggs
- 1/2 cup evaporated milk
- 1/2 cup mini marshmallows
- 1/2 cup crushed graham crackers
- 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips

## Instructions:
1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and lightly grease a mini muffin tin.
2. Roll out the pre-made pie crusts on a floured surface. Using a round cookie cutter or a glass, cut out circles approximately 2.5 inches in diameter.
3. Carefully press the circles into each cavity of the mini muffin tin, forming mini pie crusts.
4. In a mixing bowl, combine the pumpkin puree, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and salt. Mix well.
5. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, until fully incorporated.
6. Gradually add the evaporated milk while continuing to mix until smooth.
7. Fill each mini pie crust with the pumpkin mixture, about 3/4 full.
8. Bake in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, or until the pie crust edges turn golden brown and the filling is set.
9. Remove the mini pies from the oven and let them cool in the muffin tin for 5 minutes.
10. Carefully remove the mini pies from the muffin tin and transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.
11. Once cooled, top each mini pie with mini marshmallows, crushed graham crackers, and semi-sweet chocolate chips.
12. Turn on the broiler in your oven and place the topped mini pies on a baking sheet.
13. Place the baking sheet under the broiler for about 1-2 minutes, or until the marshmallows are golden and toasted. Keep a close eye on them to prevent burning.
14. Remove from the broiler and let the S'mores Pumpkin Pie Bites cool slightly before serving.
15. Enjoy these delicious bites of autumn and campfire nostalgia!
