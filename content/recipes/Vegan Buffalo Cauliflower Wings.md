## Vegan Buffalo Cauliflower Wings

### Ingredients
- 1 large cauliflower head
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup unsweetened plant-based milk
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 cup hot sauce (e.g., Frank's RedHot)
- 2 tablespoons plant-based butter, melted
- Optional: Vegan ranch or blue cheese dressing

### Instructions
1. Preheat your oven to 450°F (230°C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Rinse the cauliflower head and trim off any green leaves. Then, carefully cut it into bite-sized florets. Set aside.
3. In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, plant-based milk, garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper. Whisk until smooth, creating a thick batter.
4. Dip each cauliflower floret into the batter, making sure it's evenly coated, and shake off any excess. Arrange the coated cauliflower on the prepared baking sheet in a single layer.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the cauliflower is tender and the batter becomes golden and crispy.
6. While the cauliflower is baking, in a separate bowl, mix the hot sauce and melted plant-based butter until well combined.
7. Once the cauliflower wings are done baking, remove them from the oven and let them cool slightly. 
8. Toss the baked cauliflower wings in the buffalo sauce, making sure to coat them thoroughly.
9. Return the coated wings to the baking sheet and bake for an additional 10 minutes, until they become crispy and caramelized.
10. Serve the Vegan Buffalo Cauliflower Wings with vegan ranch or blue cheese dressing if desired. Enjoy!

Note: Adjust the amount of hot sauce according to your preferred level of spiciness. You can also adjust the thickness of the batter by adding more flour or plant-based milk as needed.
