## Pumpkin Spice Latte Truffles Recipe

### Ingredients:
- 1/4 cup pumpkin puree
- 1/4 cup brewed espresso or strongly brewed coffee, cooled
- 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1/8 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup crushed graham crackers (about 8 sheets)
- 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, for dusting

### Instructions:
1. In a small bowl, whisk together the pumpkin puree and cooled espresso until well combined. Set aside.
2. Place the chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring in between, until melted and smooth.
3. Add the pumpkin puree mixture, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, and salt to the melted chocolate. Stir until well combined.
4. Fold in the crushed graham crackers, mixing until evenly distributed throughout the chocolate mixture.
5. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1-2 hours, or until firm enough to scoop and roll into truffle balls.
6. Once the mixture has chilled, line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
7. Scoop out about 1 tablespoon of the chocolate mixture and roll it into a ball using your palms. Place the truffle ball on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining mixture.
8. Once all the truffles are rolled, place the baking sheet in the refrigerator for another 15-30 minutes to firm up.
9. In a shallow dish, place the cocoa powder. Roll each truffle in the cocoa powder to coat it fully. Place the coated truffles back on the baking sheet.
10. Refrigerate the truffles for 15-20 minutes, or until the cocoa powder sets.
11. Once set, store the Pumpkin Spice Latte Truffles in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week. Enjoy!

Note: You can also store the truffles in the freezer for longer shelf life. Just make sure to thaw them in the refrigerator before serving.
