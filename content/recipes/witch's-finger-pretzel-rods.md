## Witch's Finger Pretzel Rods Recipe

### Ingredients:

- 12 pretzel rods
- 12 sliced almonds
- 1 cup white chocolate or white candy melts
- Green food coloring
- Black food coloring (optional)

### Instructions:

1. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
2. In a microwave-safe bowl, melt the white chocolate or candy melts according to the package instructions, stirring occasionally until smooth.
3. Add a few drops of green food coloring to the melted chocolate and stir well to achieve a vibrant green color. Add more food coloring if necessary to reach the desired shade.
4. Pick up a pretzel rod and use a spoon or spatula to spread the green chocolate onto the pretzel, covering about three-quarters of its length. Leave the bottom portion uncoated, creating a "handle" for the finger.
5. Before the chocolate sets, gently press a sliced almond onto the uncoated end of the pretzel to create a fingernail. Repeat this step for each pretzel rod.
6. Place the coated pretzel rods on the prepared baking sheet and allow them to set completely at room temperature. This may take about 30 minutes to 1 hour.
7. If desired, once the green chocolate has hardened, you can use a small food-safe brush to add some black food coloring around the "nail" area to create a more realistic effect.
8. Serve the Witch's Finger Pretzel Rods at your Halloween party or enjoy them as a spooky snack!

***Note:*** *If you prefer, you can also use dark chocolate instead of white for a different look. Simply omit the green and black food coloring, and melt the dark chocolate according to the package instructions.*
