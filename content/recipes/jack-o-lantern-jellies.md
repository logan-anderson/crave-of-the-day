### Ingredients:
- 1 box (3 oz) orange flavored gelatin
- 1 cup boiling water
- 1/2 cup cold water
- 10-12 small plastic or silicone jack-o-lantern molds
- Black gel food coloring

### Instructions:
1. In a large bowl, combine the orange flavored gelatin with the boiling water. Stir until completely dissolved.
2. Add the cold water to the gelatin mixture and stir well.
3. Lightly grease the inside of the jack-o-lantern molds with non-stick spray or a small amount of vegetable oil.
4. Carefully pour the gelatin mixture into each mold, filling them almost to the top.
5. Place the molds in the refrigerator and let them set for about 1 hour, or until firm.
6. Once the gelatin has set, remove the molds from the refrigerator.
7. Dip a toothpick or skewer into the black gel food coloring and draw spooky faces on the jellies, creating the jack-o-lantern look.
8. Return the jellies to the refrigerator for an additional hour, or until fully set.
9. To unmold, gently pull on the edges of each mold. If needed, use a small knife to loosen the edges. Carefully remove the jellies from the molds.
