### **Spiced Caramel Popcorn**

Ingredients:
- 1/2 cup popcorn kernels
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter
- 1/4 cup light corn syrup
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda

Instructions:
1. Preheat your oven to 250°F (120°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set it aside.
2. In a large pot with a tight-fitting lid, heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, add the popcorn kernels and cover the pot with the lid.
3. Shake the pot occasionally to keep the kernels from burning. Continue shaking until the popping slows down, then remove the pot from heat and let it sit for a minute to ensure all the kernels have popped.
4. Transfer the popped popcorn to a large bowl, removing any unpopped kernels. Set aside.
5. In a separate saucepan, combine the sugar, butter, corn syrup, salt, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and cayenne pepper (if desired). Place the saucepan over medium heat and stir until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture comes to a simmer.
6. Allow the mixture to simmer for 4-5 minutes without stirring. The mixture should turn into a caramel color. Remove the saucepan from heat and stir in the vanilla extract and baking soda. The mixture will foam up, so be careful.
7. Working quickly, pour the caramel sauce over the popcorn in the bowl. Use a spatula or wooden spoon to gently toss and coat the popcorn evenly with the caramel sauce.
8. Transfer the coated popcorn onto the prepared baking sheet, spreading it out in an even layer.
9. Bake the popcorn in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, stirring every 15 minutes to ensure even baking.
10. After 45 minutes, remove the popcorn from the oven and let it cool completely on the baking sheet. It will crisp up as it cools.
11. Break up any large clumps of caramel popcorn and transfer it to an airtight container. Enjoy immediately or store for up to a week.
