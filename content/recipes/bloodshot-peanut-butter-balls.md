A delicious and spooky treat for Halloween or any spooky gathering!

## Ingredients
- 1 cup creamy peanut butter
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
- 2 cups powdered sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- Red gel food coloring
- 24 white chocolate chips
- Black gel food coloring

## Instructions
1. In a mixing bowl, combine the creamy peanut butter and softened unsalted butter.
2. Gradually add the powdered sugar into the peanut butter mixture while continuously mixing.
3. Add the vanilla extract and salt, and mix until combined and the mixture forms a dough.
4. Divide the dough into two equal parts.
5. Add a few drops of red gel food coloring to one part of the dough and mix until the desired bloodshot color is achieved.
6. Roll the plain peanut butter dough into small balls, about 1 inch in diameter, and place them on a parchment-lined baking sheet.
7. Take a small portion of the red-colored dough and flatten it slightly. Place it on top of each peanut butter ball, creating a "bloodshot" effect. Repeat for all peanut butter balls.
8. Gently press a white chocolate chip into the center of the red portion to resemble the eye.
9. Use a toothpick dipped in black gel food coloring to add veins and create a bloodshot effect around the white chocolate chip.
10. Place the baking sheet in the refrigerator and chill the peanut butter balls for about 30 minutes or until firm.
11. Once firm, remove from the refrigerator and let them sit at room temperature for a few minutes before serving.
12. Serve and enjoy these spooky Bloodshot Peanut Butter Balls at your Halloween party or any other spooky gathering!

**Note**: Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week.

Enjoy and have a spooktacular time!
