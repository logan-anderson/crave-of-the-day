## Mulled Wine Gummies Recipe

#### Ingredients:
- 1¼ cups red wine
- ½ cup orange juice
- ¼ cup granulated sugar
- 4 gelatin sheets
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 3 whole cloves
- Zest of 1 orange
- Cooking spray

#### Instructions:
1. In a medium saucepan, combine the red wine, orange juice, granulated sugar, cinnamon stick, cloves, and orange zest. Heat over medium heat until the mixture begins to simmer. Let it simmer for about 10 minutes to infuse the flavors.
2. Meanwhile, place the gelatin sheets in a bowl of cold water and let them soften for about 5 minutes.
3. Remove the saucepan from heat. Discard the cinnamon stick and cloves, and remove as much of the orange zest as possible.
4. Squeeze any excess water from the softened gelatin sheets, then add them to the hot wine mixture. Stir until the gelatin is completely dissolved.
5. Lightly coat a gummy bear mold or ice cube tray with cooking spray.
6. Carefully pour the mulled wine mixture into the prepared mold or tray, filling each cavity to the top.
7. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours or until the gummies are set.
8. Once set, remove the gummies from the mold or tray and store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
9. Enjoy these delicious mulled wine gummies as a sweet and boozy treat or give them as a thoughtful homemade gift!
