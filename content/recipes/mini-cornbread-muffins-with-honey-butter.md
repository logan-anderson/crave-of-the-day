#### Mini Cornbread Muffins with Honey Butter Recipe

**Ingredients:**

For the muffins:
- 1 cup cornmeal
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup milk
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled
- 1/4 cup honey
- 1 large egg

For the honey butter:
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 2 tablespoons honey

**Instructions:**

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C) and grease a mini muffin tin or line it with mini muffin liners.

2. In a large bowl, whisk together the cornmeal, all-purpose flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.

3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, melted butter, honey, and egg.

4. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not overmix.

5. Spoon the batter into the prepared mini muffin tin, filling each cup about 2/3 full.

6. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the muffins are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

7. While the muffins are baking, prepare the honey butter by combining the softened butter and honey in a small bowl. Stir until well combined.

8. Remove the muffins from the oven and let them cool in the tin for a few minutes. Then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.

9. Serve the mini cornbread muffins with the honey butter on the side for spreading. Enjoy!

Note: This recipe makes approximately 24 mini cornbread muffins. Adjust baking time if using a different size muffin tin.
