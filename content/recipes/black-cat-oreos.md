## Recipe: Black Cat Oreos

### Ingredients:
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup packed brown sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Black food coloring gel (optional)
- 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
- 2 tablespoons vegetable shortening
- Black candy melts or black candy coating

### Instructions:
1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking mat.

2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.

3. In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar using an electric mixer until light and fluffy.

4. Add the egg and vanilla extract to the butter mixture and beat well until fully combined. If desired, add a few drops of black food coloring gel to achieve a darker color.

5. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Do not overmix.

6. Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop rounded dough portions onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.

7. Bake in the preheated oven for 8-10 minutes, or until the cookies have slightly spread and are set around the edges. Avoid overbaking, as they will firm up as they cool. 

8. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.

9. Once the cookies have cooled, prepare the black cat faces. In a medium microwave-safe bowl, melt the semi-sweet chocolate chips with the vegetable shortening in 30-second intervals, stirring in between, until smooth.

10. Dip each cookie into the melted chocolate, coating about half the cookie. Place the chocolate-dipped cookies back onto the parchment paper or silicone mat.

11. While the chocolate is still wet, attach two black candy melts or candy coating pieces as ears near the top of the dipped portion, and one for the cat's nose in the center.

12. Allow the cookies to set at room temperature for about an hour, or refrigerate them for 20-30 minutes until the chocolate is firm.

13. Once the chocolate has fully hardened, black cat Oreo cookies are ready to enjoy! Store them in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.

Enjoy these cute and delicious Black Cat Oreos with your family and friends!
