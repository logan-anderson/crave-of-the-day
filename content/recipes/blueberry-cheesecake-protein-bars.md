Prepare time: 15 minutes  
Cook time: 25 minutes  
Total time: 40 minutes  

## Ingredients:

- 1 cup blueberries
- 1 cup rolled oats
- 1/2 cup almond flour
- 1/2 cup vanilla protein powder
- 1/4 cup honey
- 1/4 cup almond butter
- 1/4 cup Greek yogurt
- 2 tablespoons coconut oil, melted
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

## Instructions:

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a baking dish or line it with parchment paper for easy removal later.
2. In a food processor or blender, pulse the rolled oats until they resemble a coarse flour-like texture.
3. In a large mixing bowl, combine the oat flour, almond flour, protein powder, cinnamon, and salt. Mix well.
4. Add the honey, almond butter, Greek yogurt, melted coconut oil, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Stir until the mixture forms a sticky batter.
5. Gently fold in the blueberries, being careful not to crush them.
6. Transfer the batter into the prepared baking dish, spreading it evenly and pressing it down with your hands or a spatula.
7. Bake in the preheated oven for approximately 25 minutes, or until the edges turn golden brown.
8. Remove from the oven and let it cool completely in the baking dish before cutting into bars.
9. Once cooled, cut into desired bar sizes and refrigerate for at least 1 hour to firm up.
10. Serve and enjoy as a protein-packed snack or dessert!

**Chef's Tip:** These bars can be individually wrapped and stored in the refrigerator for up to one week. They are a great grab-and-go option for a quick and healthy snack during the day!
