## Mango Chili Fruit Roll-Ups

### Ingredients:
- 4 ripe mangoes
- 1 tsp lemon juice
- 1-2 tbsp honey or maple syrup (optional, for added sweetness)
- 1 tsp chili powder
- 1/4 tsp salt

### Instructions:
1. Peel and chop the mangoes into small pieces. Discard the seeds and skin.
2. Place the mango pieces in a blender or food processor along with the lemon juice, honey (if using), chili powder, and salt.
3. Blend the mixture until smooth and well-combined.
4. Preheat your oven to 175°F (80°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
5. Pour the mango mixture onto the parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Use a spatula to spread it evenly into a thin layer, about 1/8 inch thick.
6. Place the baking sheet into the preheated oven and bake for 4-6 hours, or until the fruit mixture is no longer sticky to touch.
7. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and let it cool completely.
8. Once cooled, carefully peel the fruit roll-up off the parchment paper.
9. Cut the roll-up into strips of desired width.
10. Roll each strip tightly and store in an airtight container or wrap them individually with parchment paper.
