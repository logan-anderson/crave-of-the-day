Sure! Here's a recipe for Hot Cocoa Cookie Cups:

## Ingredients
- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup packed brown sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 12 marshmallows
- 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips

## Instructions
1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a muffin tin or line it with cupcake liners. Set aside.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
3. In a separate large bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. This can be done using a hand mixer or stand mixer on medium speed.
4. Beat in the egg and vanilla extract until well combined.
5. Gradually add the dry ingredient mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Do not overmix.
6. Roll the cookie dough into 1-inch balls and place each ball into the cups of the prepared muffin tin. Press the dough against the bottom and up the sides of the cups to form a cup shape.
7. Bake the cookie cups in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes or until set.
8. Remove the muffin tin from the oven and immediately press a marshmallow into the center of each cookie cup. Allow the cookie cups to cool in the tin for 5 minutes.
9. After 5 minutes, gently remove the cookie cups from the muffin tin and transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.
10. Once the cookie cups have cooled, melt the mini chocolate chips in the microwave or on the stovetop using a double boiler.
11. Drizzle the melted chocolate over the tops of the cooled cookie cups.
12. Let the chocolate set before serving the Hot Cocoa Cookie Cups.
