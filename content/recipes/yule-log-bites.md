Here's a recipe for Yule Log Bites:

## Ingredients:

- 1 cup powdered sugar
- 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/4 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 3 large eggs
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

## For the Filling:

- 1 cup heavy cream
- 2 tablespoons powdered sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

## For the Chocolate Ganache:

- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips

## For Decorating:

- Powdered sugar
- Meringue mushrooms
- Fresh mint leaves

## Instructions:

1. Preheat your oven to 350Â°F (175Â°C). Grease and line a 10x15-inch baking pan with parchment paper.
2. In a medium mixing bowl, combine the powdered sugar, cocoa powder, all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.
3. In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs with an electric mixer for about 5 minutes until thick and pale yellow.
4. Gradually add the granulated sugar to the beaten eggs while continuing to beat until fully incorporated. Mix in the vanilla extract.
5. Fold in the dry ingredient mixture using a spatula, making sure everything is well combined. Finally, fold in the melted butter.
6. Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan, spreading it evenly.
7. Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
8. While the cake is still warm, carefully roll it with the parchment paper from the narrow end. Let it cool rolled up.
9. In a separate mixing bowl, whip the heavy cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract together until stiff peaks form to create the filling.
10. Once the cake has cooled, carefully unroll it and spread the whipped cream filling evenly over the surface.
11. Re-roll the cake tightly, without the parchment paper, starting from the narrow end. Place it seam-side-down on a serving plate.
12. In a small saucepan, heat the heavy cream for the chocolate ganache until it just begins to simmer.
13. Remove from heat and pour the hot cream over the semisweet chocolate chips in a heatproof bowl. Let it sit for 2 minutes, then stir until smooth and glossy.
14. Pour the chocolate ganache over the rolled cake, allowing it to drip down the sides.
15. Refrigerate the Yule Log Bites for at least 1 hour to allow the ganache to set.
16. Once chilled, trim off the ends of the cake and slice it into 1-inch thick rounds to create Yule Log Bites.
17. Dust the bites with powdered sugar and garnish with meringue mushrooms and fresh mint leaves.
18. Serve and enjoy your delightful Yule Log Bites!

Wishing you a joyful and delicious holiday season! ðŸŽ„
