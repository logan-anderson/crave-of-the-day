**Instructions:**
1. In a food processor, combine the drained chickpeas, tahini, olive oil, minced garlic, and fresh lemon juice. Process until smooth and creamy.

2. Add the ground cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, salt, and black pepper to the food processor. Process again until well combined and the spices are evenly distributed.
