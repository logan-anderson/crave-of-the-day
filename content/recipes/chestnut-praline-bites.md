# Chestnut Praline Bites Recipe

## Ingredients
- 1 cup chestnuts, roasted and peeled
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1/4 cup water
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 8 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped
- 1/4 cup crushed chestnuts, for garnish

## Instructions
1. In a food processor, pulse the roasted chestnuts until chopped into small pieces.
2. In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar, water, and salt. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves and the mixture comes to a boil.
3. Reduce the heat to low and add the chopped chestnuts to the saucepan. Stir continuously until the chestnuts are coated with the sugar syrup and it thickens, about 5-7 minutes.
4. Remove the saucepan from heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Allow the mixture to cool for a few minutes until it thickens slightly.
5. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Drop spoonfuls of the chestnut praline mixture onto the prepared baking sheet, forming small bite-sized mounds. Let them cool completely and set aside.
6. In a microwave-safe bowl, melt the chopped semisweet chocolate in the microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring well after each interval until smooth and fully melted.
7. Using a fork, dip each chestnut praline bite into the melted chocolate, making sure to coat it completely. Allow the excess chocolate to drip off and place the coated bite back onto the parchment paper-lined baking sheet.
8. Sprinkle each chocolate-coated bite with crushed chestnuts for garnish. Let them set at room temperature until the chocolate hardens.
9. Once the chocolate is fully hardened, transfer the chestnut praline bites to an airtight container and store them in a cool, dry place.
