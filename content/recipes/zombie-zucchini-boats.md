## Recipe: Zombie Zucchini Boats

### Ingredients:
- 4 medium-sized zucchinis

### Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).

4. Add the zucchini pulp to the skillet and cook for another 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.
5. Stir in cooked quinoa, black beans, shredded chicken (optional), dried oregano, dried basil, chili powder, salt, and pepper. Mix well to combine all the ingredients.
6. Spoon the filling mixture evenly into the zucchini boats, pressing down gently.
7. Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese over the top of each zucchini boat.
8. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the zucchinis are tender and the cheese is melted and golden brown.
9. Remove from the oven and let cool for a few minutes before serving.
10. Serve the Zombie Zucchini Boats as a tasty and healthy main dish or a fun Halloween appetizer. Enjoy!
