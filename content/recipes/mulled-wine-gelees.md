# Mulled Wine Gelees Recipe

## Ingredients:
- 2 cups red wine
- 1 cup orange juice
- 1 cup sugar
- 4 whole cloves
- 2 cinnamon sticks
- 3 envelopes unflavored gelatin
- Zest of 1 orange
- Orange slices (for garnish)

## Instructions:
1. In a saucepan, combine the red wine, orange juice, sugar, cloves, and cinnamon sticks.
2. Heat the mixture over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves completely.
3. Once the sugar has dissolved, increase the heat to medium and bring the mixture to a gentle simmer. Let it simmer for 5-10 minutes, allowing the flavors to infuse.
4. While the wine mixture simmers, prepare the gelatin. In a small bowl, combine the gelatin with 3/4 cup cold water. Stir until the gelatin granules dissolve completely.
5. Remove the pan from heat and stir in the gelatin mixture. Continue stirring until the gelatin is fully dissolved.
6. Stir in the orange zest, and let the mixture cool for a few minutes.
7. Pour the mixture into individual molds or a shallow dish. Allow it to cool completely before refrigerating for at least 4 hours or until firm.
8. Once the gel√©e has set, remove it from the molds or cut it into small squares if using a dish.
9. Serve the mulled wine gelees chilled, garnished with orange slices on top.

Enjoy your delightful Mulled Wine Gelees!
