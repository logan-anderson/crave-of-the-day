# Rudolph's Red Velvet Bites

## Ingredients:
- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/3 cup vegetable oil
- 2/3 cup buttermilk
- 1 large egg
- 1 tablespoon red food coloring
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 teaspoon white distilled vinegar

## Cream Cheese Frosting:
- 4 oz cream cheese, softened
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
- 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease or line a mini muffin tin with paper liners.

2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt until well combined.

3. In a separate large bowl, whisk together the vegetable oil, buttermilk, egg, red food coloring, vanilla extract, and white vinegar until smooth.

4. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing with a spatula until just combined.

5. Spoon the batter into the mini muffin tin, filling each cup about 2/3 full.

6. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.

7. Remove from the oven and let the red velvet bites cool in the tin for 5 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.

8. While the red velvet bites are cooling, prepare the cream cheese frosting. In a bowl, beat together the softened cream cheese and butter until creamy and smooth.

9. Gradually add in the powdered sugar and vanilla extract, beating until well combined and fluffy.

10. Once the red velvet bites have cooled, pipe or spread a dollop of cream cheese frosting onto the top of each bite.

11. Serve and enjoy these delightful Rudolph's Red Velvet Bites.
