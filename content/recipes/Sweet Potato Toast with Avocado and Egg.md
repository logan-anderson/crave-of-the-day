# Sweet Potato Toast with Avocado and Egg

## Ingredients:
- 1 large sweet potato
- 1 ripe avocado
- 2 eggs
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Optional toppings: sliced tomatoes, crumbled feta cheese, chopped cilantro

## Instructions:
1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).
2. Wash and dry the sweet potato, then slice it lengthwise into 1/4-inch thick slices.
3. Place the sweet potato slices on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Make sure to spread them out in a single layer.
4. Bake the sweet potato slices for about 15-20 minutes until they are cooked through and slightly crispy. 
5. While the sweet potato is baking, prepare the avocado. Cut the avocado in half, remove the pit, and scoop out the flesh into a small bowl. Mash it with a fork until smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
6. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Crack the eggs into the skillet and cook until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny, about 3-4 minutes.
7. Remove the sweet potato slices from the oven and let them cool for a minute.
8. Spread a generous amount of mashed avocado onto each sweet potato slice.
9. Carefully place a fried egg on top of the avocado.
10. Season with salt and pepper, and add any optional toppings if desired.
11. Serve immediately and enjoy!
