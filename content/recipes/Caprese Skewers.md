# Caprese Skewers Recipe

## Ingredients:
- 1 pint cherry tomatoes
- 1 pound fresh mozzarella cheese
- Fresh basil leaves
- Balsamic glaze
- Extra-virgin olive oil
- Salt and black pepper, to taste
- Wooden skewers

## Instructions:
1. Start by soaking the wooden skewers in water for about 30 minutes to prevent them from burning while grilling.
2. Rinse the cherry tomatoes and pat them dry. Cut the mozzarella cheese into bite-sized cubes.
3. Assemble the skewers by alternating between a cherry tomato, a cube of mozzarella cheese, and a fresh basil leaf. Repeat until all the ingredients are used.
4. Season the skewers with salt and black pepper according to taste.
5. Preheat the grill or stovetop grill pan to medium-high heat.
6. Drizzle the skewers with extra-virgin olive oil on both sides.
7. Place the skewers on the grill and cook for about 2-3 minutes per side, or until the mozzarella cheese starts to melt and the tomatoes slightly blister.
8. Remove the skewers from the heat and let them cool for a minute.
9. Drizzle the caprese skewers with balsamic glaze.
10. Serve immediately and enjoy!

Note: If you prefer a vegetarian option, you can also substitute the fresh mozzarella cheese with cherry-sized bocconcini.
