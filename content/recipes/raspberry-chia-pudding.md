Sure! Here's a recipe for Raspberry Chia Pudding:

## Raspberry Chia Pudding

### Ingredients:
- 1 cup raspberries (fresh or frozen)
- 1 1/2 cups unsweetened almond milk (or any milk of your choice)
- 1/4 cup chia seeds
- 1-2 tablespoons maple syrup or honey (optional)
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Fresh raspberries and mint leaves (for garnish)

### Instructions:
1. In a blender, combine the raspberries and almond milk. Blend until smooth.
2. In a mixing bowl, pour the raspberry mixture and add chia seeds, maple syrup (or honey), and vanilla extract. Stir well to combine.
3. Allow the mixture to sit for 5 minutes and then stir again to ensure the chia seeds are evenly distributed.
4. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight. The chia seeds will absorb the liquid and thicken to form a pudding-like consistency.
5. Give the pudding a good stir before serving. If desired, you can adjust the sweetness by adding more maple syrup or honey.
6. Serve the Raspberry Chia Pudding in individual bowls or glasses. Garnish with fresh raspberries and mint leaves.
7. Enjoy your delicious and nutritious Raspberry Chia Pudding!

Note: Feel free to customize your chia pudding by adding toppings such as sliced almonds, coconut flakes, or other fresh fruits to enhance the flavor and texture.
