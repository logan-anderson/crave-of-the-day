## Garlic-Herb Roasted Chickpeas

### **Ingredients:**

- 2 cans (15 ounces each) chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained and rinsed
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon dried rosemary
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper

### **Instructions:**

1. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).

2. Drain and rinse the chickpeas, then pat them dry using a clean kitchen towel or paper towels.

3. In a large bowl, combine the chickpeas, olive oil, minced garlic, dried rosemary, dried thyme, salt, and black pepper. Toss well to ensure even coating.

4. Spread the seasoned chickpeas in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or aluminum foil.

5. Roast in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the chickpeas are golden brown and crispy. Make sure to stir or shake the pan halfway through the cooking time to ensure even browning.

6. Once done, remove the baking sheet from the oven and allow the roasted chickpeas to cool slightly. They will become even crispier as they cool.

7. Serve the Garlic-Herb Roasted Chickpeas as a delicious and healthy snack, or use them as a crunchy topping for salads or soups. Enjoy!

Note: Store any leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to three days.
