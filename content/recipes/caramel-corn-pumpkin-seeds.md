## Caramel Corn Pumpkin Seeds

### Ingredients:
- 2 cups pumpkin seeds, rinsed and dried
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1/4 cup brown sugar
- 1/4 cup light corn syrup
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1/8 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1/8 teaspoon ground allspice

### Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone mat.
2. In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the granulated sugar, brown sugar, corn syrup, vanilla extract, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, ginger, and allspice to the saucepan. Stir until the sugars are dissolved and the mixture is well combined.
3. Add the pumpkin seeds to the saucepan and toss to coat them evenly with the caramel mixture.
4. Spread the coated pumpkin seeds onto the prepared baking sheet in a single layer.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, or until the pumpkin seeds are golden brown and crispy. Stir occasionally during baking to ensure even cooking.
6. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and let the pumpkin seeds cool completely on the sheet.
7. Once cooled, break apart any clumps of caramel corn pumpkin seeds into bite-sized pieces.
8. Serve immediately or store in an airtight container for up to one week.
