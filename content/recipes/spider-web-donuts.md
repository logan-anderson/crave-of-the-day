## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted
- 1/4 cup vegetable oil
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup milk
- Oil, for frying
- 1 cup powdered sugar
- 2 tablespoons milk
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Black gel food coloring
- Gummy spiders, for decoration

## Instructions

1. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, granulated sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg.

2. In a separate bowl, whisk together the melted butter, vegetable oil, eggs, vanilla extract, and milk until well combined.

3. Gradually pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense texture.

4. Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 350¬∞F (175¬∞C).

5. Carefully drop spoonfuls of the donut batter into the hot oil, frying a few at a time. Cook for 2-3 minutes or until lightly golden brown, turning them over halfway through the cooking time.

6. Remove the fried donuts from the oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to absorb any excess oil.

7. In a small bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla extract, to make the glaze.

8. Divide the glaze into two equal parts. Leave one part white and color the other part black with the gel food coloring. Transfer both glazes to separate piping bags or ziplock bags with a small corner snipped off.

9. Once the donuts have cooled slightly, pipe a spiral of white glaze onto each donut. Start from the center and work your way towards the edges.

10. Using the black glaze, pipe lines from the center of the spiral outwards, creating a spider web pattern. Start with a straight line from the center to the edge, then create curved lines connecting to the straight line, resembling the spokes of a bicycle wheel.

11. Place a gummy spider in the center of each donut, pressing it gently into the glaze.

12. Allow the glaze to set for a few minutes before serving.

Enjoy these delicious and spooky spider web donuts with your friends and family. Happy Halloween! üï∑Ô∏èüï∏Ô∏è
