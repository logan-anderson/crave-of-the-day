For a spooky twist on a classic favorite, try these Haunted House Pizza Bites. Easy to make and perfect for Halloween parties, these bite-sized treats are sure to delight both kids and adults alike!

## Ingredients:
- 1 package of refrigerated pizza dough
- 1 cup of pizza sauce
- 2 cups of shredded mozzarella cheese
- Mini pepperoni slices
- Black olives (pitted and sliced)
- Red bell pepper (thinly sliced)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat your oven to 375Â°F (190Â°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Roll out the pizza dough onto a lightly floured surface to create a rectangle about Â¼ inch thick.
3. Using a sharp knife or pizza cutter, cut the dough into small squares or rectangles, approximately 2-3 inches in size. These will be the bases for your haunted house pizza bites.
4. Arrange the dough pieces on the prepared baking sheet, leaving a small gap between each one.
5. Spoon a teaspoon or two of pizza sauce onto each dough piece, spreading it out evenly.
6. Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.
7. Now, it's time to get creative! Use the mini pepperoni slices to create spooky ghost-like shapes on top of the cheese layer. You can also use them to make spooky faces or any other Halloween-inspired designs.
8. Place two sliced black olives on each pizza bite to resemble creepy eyes.
9. Use thinly sliced red bell pepper to create menacing mouth shapes for some of the bites. Get creative and make a variety of expressions to add to the spookiness.
10. Once you finish decorating your haunted house pizza bites, carefully place the baking sheet in the preheated oven.
11. Bake for approximately 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
12. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and let the pizza bites cool for a few minutes before serving.
13. Serve your Haunted House Pizza Bites on a platter, and watch them disappear as if by magic!

Enjoy these delicious and spooky pizza bites with your loved ones this Halloween season. Happy haunting! ðŸ‘»
