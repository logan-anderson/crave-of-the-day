# St. Nick's Savory Breadsticks

## Ingredients
- 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 teaspoons garlic powder
- 2 teaspoons dried oregano
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1 1/8 teaspoon active dry yeast
- 1 cup warm water
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1/4 cup melted butter
- Coarse sea salt, for topping
- Chopped fresh parsley, for garnish

## Instructions
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, dried oregano, salt, and sugar.
2. In a separate small bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water and let stand for 5 minutes until frothy.
3. Pour the yeast mixture into the dry ingredients. Add the olive oil, then stir well to form a dough.
4. Transfer the dough to a floured surface. Knead for 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.
5. Place the dough in an oiled bowl, cover with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm area for 1 hour, or until doubled in size.
6. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
7. Punch down the dough and divide it into 16 equal portions. Roll each portion into a thin rope shape.
8. Arrange the rolled dough ropes on the prepared baking sheet, leaving a little space between each.
9. Brush the breadsticks with melted butter, then sprinkle coarse sea salt over the top for extra flavor.
10. Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy.
11. Remove from the oven and let the breadsticks cool slightly on a wire rack.
12. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley before serving. Optionally, serve with marinara sauce or your favorite dip.
