## Ginger Stars Recipe

### Ingredients:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons ground ginger
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup molasses
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Optional: powdered sugar for dusting

### Instructions:
1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, ginger, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt until well combined. Set aside.
3. In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy.
4. Add the molasses, egg, and vanilla extract to the butter-sugar mixture. Mix until fully incorporated.
5. Gradually add the dry ingredient mixture to the wet ingredients. Mix until just combined, ensuring not to overmix the dough.
6. Divide the dough in half. Take one portion and roll it out on a lightly floured surface until it's about 1/4 inch thick.
7. Use star-shaped cookie cutters to cut out cookies from the rolled dough. Place them on the prepared baking sheet, leaving a little space between the cookies.
8. Repeat the rolling and cutting process with the other half of the dough.
9. Bake the cookies for about 8-10 minutes, or until the edges turn slightly golden.
10. Allow the Ginger Stars to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes, then transfer them to wire racks to cool completely.
11. Once completely cooled, you can sprinkle powdered sugar on top of the Ginger Stars for an added touch (optional).
12. Serve and enjoy your delicious homemade Ginger Stars!

Note: This recipe makes approximately 2 dozen Ginger Stars, depending on your cookie cutter size. Adjust the baking time accordingly if you prefer a softer or crisper texture.
