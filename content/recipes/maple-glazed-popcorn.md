Enjoy the perfect combination of sweet and crunchy with this delicious Maple Glazed Popcorn recipe. It's a delectable treat that will satisfy your snack cravings. 

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup popcorn kernels
- 1/4 cup pure maple syrup
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1/4 teaspoon sea salt
- 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Place a large, deep pot over medium heat and add the popcorn kernels. Cover the pot with a lid, leaving a small gap for steam to escape.
2. Shake the pot occasionally to ensure even popping. Continue until the popping sound slows down significantly, then remove the pot from heat and let it cool slightly.
3. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Once melted, stir in the maple syrup, sea salt, and vanilla extract. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring continuously until the mixture is well combined and slightly thickened.
4. Pour the maple glaze over the popcorn and toss gently to coat. Make sure to evenly distribute the glaze.
5. Transfer the coated popcorn to a large baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Spread it out in a single layer, allowing it to cool and harden for about 15-20 minutes.
6. Once the glaze has solidified, break apart any clusters and transfer the Maple Glazed Popcorn to an airtight container for storage.
7. Serve and enjoy this irresistible Maple Glazed Popcorn whenever you crave a maple-infused snack!

Note: You can customize this recipe by adding chopped nuts or a sprinkle of cinnamon for added flavor and texture.
