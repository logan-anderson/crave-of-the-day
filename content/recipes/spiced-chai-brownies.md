## Ingredients:

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
- 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup brewed chai tea, cooled
- Optional: powdered sugar for dusting

## Instructions:

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a square baking pan (8x8 inch) and line it with parchment paper, leaving some overhang for easy removal.

2. In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, cloves, nutmeg, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.

3. In a large mixing bowl, combine the melted butter and granulated sugar. Mix until well combined.

4. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.

5. Slowly add the dry ingredient mixture to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.

6. Gradually pour in the brewed chai tea, stirring gently until the batter is smooth and homogeneous.

7. Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan, spreading it evenly.

8. Bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs.

9. Remove the brownies from the oven and allow them to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Then, using the parchment paper overhang, lift the brownies out of the pan and transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.

10. Once cooled, cut into squares and optionally dust with powdered sugar for a decorative touch.

11. Enjoy the deliciously spiced chai brownies on their own, or serve them with a hot cup of chai tea!

Note: Store the brownies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days.
