## Frozen Peppermint Cheesecake Squares

### Ingredients:
- 2 cups chocolate cookie crumbs
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- 2 (8 oz) packages cream cheese, softened
- 1 cup powdered sugar
- 1 teaspoon peppermint extract
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1/2 cup crushed peppermint candies
- Green food coloring (optional)
- Whipped cream, for serving
- Extra crushed peppermint candies, for garnish

### Instructions:
1. In a mixing bowl, combine chocolate cookie crumbs and melted butter. Stir until well combined.
2. Press the cookie mixture evenly into the bottom of a 9x9-inch square baking dish. Place in the freezer to set while preparing the filling.
3. In a separate mixing bowl, beat cream cheese until smooth and creamy.
4. Add powdered sugar and peppermint extract to the cream cheese. Mix until well combined.
5. In another bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form.
6. Gently fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture.
7. If desired, add a few drops of green food coloring to tint the filling.
8. Fold in crushed peppermint candies.
9. Retrieve the baking dish from the freezer and spread the cheesecake filling over the cookie crust. Smooth the top with a spatula.
10. Cover the baking dish with foil or plastic wrap and place in the freezer for at least 4 hours or overnight until firm.
11. Once the cheesecake is frozen, remove it from the freezer and let it sit at room temperature for a few minutes to soften slightly. This will make it easier to cut into squares.
12. Use a sharp knife to slice the cheesecake into squares of desired size.
13. Serve frozen peppermint cheesecake squares with a dollop of whipped cream and a sprinkle of crushed peppermint candies on top.
14. Enjoy!
