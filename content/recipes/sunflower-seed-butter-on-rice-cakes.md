# Sunflower Seed Butter on Rice Cakes

Here's a simple and delicious recipe to enjoy Sunflower Seed Butter on Rice Cakes!

## Ingredients

- 1 cup raw sunflower seeds
- 1 tablespoon neutral oil (such as sunflower or grapeseed oil)
- 1 tablespoon pure maple syrup (optional)
- Sprinkle of sea salt (optional)
- Rice cakes

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).

2. Spread the sunflower seeds evenly on a baking sheet and roast them in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes until they turn lightly golden. Keep an eye on them to prevent burning.

3. Allow the roasted sunflower seeds to cool slightly before transferring them to a food processor or high-speed blender.

4. Process the sunflower seeds for 2-3 minutes until they start breaking down and turn into a meal-like consistency.

5. Add the neutral oil to the processor and continue processing for another 3-4 minutes. You may need to stop and scrape down the sides occasionally for an even texture.

6. If desired, add the optional maple syrup and a sprinkle of sea salt for extra flavor. Process for an additional minute to combine all ingredients thoroughly.

7. Taste the sunflower seed butter and adjust the sweetness or saltiness to your preference.

8. Once you achieve a smooth and creamy consistency, transfer the sunflower seed butter to a jar or airtight container. It can be stored at room temperature for up to 2 weeks or refrigerated for longer freshness.

9. To serve, spread a generous amount of sunflower seed butter onto rice cakes and enjoy as a healthy and tasty snack!
