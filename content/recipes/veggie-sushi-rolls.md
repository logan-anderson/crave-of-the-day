## Veggie Sushi Rolls

### Ingredients:
- 4 nori seaweed sheets
- 1 cup sushi rice
- 1/4 cup rice vinegar
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cucumber, cut into long thin strips
- 1/2 carrot, cut into long thin strips
- 1/2 avocado, sliced
- 1/4 red bell pepper, cut into long thin strips
- Soy sauce, for dipping
- Pickled ginger, for serving
- Wasabi, for serving

### Instructions:
1. Rinse the sushi rice in cold water until the water runs clear. Cook the rice according to the package instructions.
2. While the rice is cooking, combine the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl. Mix until the sugar and salt dissolve.
3. When the rice is cooked, transfer it to a large bowl. Gradually pour the vinegar mixture over the rice, gently folding it in with a wooden spoon to combine. Allow the rice to cool to room temperature.
4. Place a bamboo sushi mat on a flat surface. Lay a sheet of nori seaweed on top of the mat.
5. Wet your hands with water to prevent sticking, and take a handful of sushi rice. Spread the rice evenly over the nori, leaving a 1-inch border at the top.
6. Arrange a few cucumber, carrot, avocado, and bell pepper strips in a line, about 1 inch away from the bottom edge of the nori.
7. Starting from the bottom, use the bamboo mat to gently roll the sushi tightly. Apply even pressure while rolling to ensure a compact roll.
8. Continue rolling until the entire sheet of nori is wrapped around the filling. Moisten the top border of the nori with water to seal the roll.
9. Repeat the process to make additional rolls.
10. Once all the rolls are made, use a sharp knife to slice each roll into bite-sized pieces.
11. Serve the veggie sushi rolls with soy sauce, pickled ginger, and wasabi on the side for dipping.
