## Ingredients:
- **For the Eclairs:**
  - 1 cup water
  - 1/2 cup unsalted butter
  - 1/4 teaspoon salt
  - 1 cup all-purpose flour
  - 4 large eggs

- **For the Filling:**
  - 2 cups heavy cream
  - 1/4 cup powdered sugar
  - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

- **For the Glaze:**
  - 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
  - 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
  - 2 tablespoons corn syrup
  - Optional toppings: crushed peanuts, sprinkles, etc.

## Instructions:
1. **Make the Eclairs:**
   - Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
   - In a medium saucepan, bring water, butter, and salt to a boil over medium heat.
   - Reduce heat to low, add flour, and stir vigorously until a smooth dough forms. Cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, stirring continuously.
   - Remove from heat and let the dough cool for a few minutes.
   - Add eggs, one at a time, and beat well after each addition until the dough is smooth and glossy.
   - Transfer the dough to a piping bag fitted with a large round tip.
   - Pipe the dough into 4- to 5-inch long strips onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving space between each strip.
   - Bake for 20-25 minutes or until the eclairs are golden brown and puffed up.
   - Remove from the oven and let cool completely on a wire rack.

2. **Prepare the Filling:**
   - In a mixing bowl, beat the heavy cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract until stiff peaks form.
   - Transfer the whipped cream into a piping bag fitted with a narrow round tip.

3. **Fill the Eclairs:**
   - Once the eclairs have cooled completely, use a sharp knife to make a small slit on the side of each eclair.
   - Insert the piping tip into the slit and fill each eclair with the whipped cream filling until it's nicely stuffed.

4. **Make the Glaze:**
   - In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the chocolate chips, butter, and corn syrup.
   - Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring well in between until the chocolate is melted and the glaze is smooth.

5. **Glaze the Eclairs:**
   - Dip the top of each eclair into the chocolate glaze, allowing any excess to drip off.
   - Place the glazed eclairs on a wire rack and let the glaze set for a few minutes.

6. **Serve:**
   - Optionally, you can top the eclairs with crushed peanuts, sprinkles, or any desired toppings while the glaze is still wet.
   - Serve the Executioner’s Eclairs immediately and enjoy!

**Note:** This recipe makes approximately 12-15 eclairs, depending on their size. Refrigerate any leftovers in an airtight container for up to 2 days.
