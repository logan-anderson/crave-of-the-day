## Stuffed Mushrooms with Cream Cheese and Chives

Ingredients:
- 16 large white mushrooms
- 8 ounces cream cheese, softened
- 2 tablespoons fresh chives, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Olive oil for brushing

Instructions:
1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. Wash the mushrooms and carefully remove the stems. Set the mushroom caps aside.
3. Finely chop the mushroom stems and place them in a mixing bowl.
4. Add the softened cream cheese, chives, minced garlic, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper to the bowl. Mix well until all ingredients are fully incorporated.
5. Take a spoonful of the cream cheese mixture and stuff it into each mushroom cap, filling them generously.
6. Arrange the stuffed mushrooms on a baking sheet or in a baking dish, making sure they are evenly spaced.
7. Lightly brush the mushroom caps with olive oil to prevent them from drying out while baking.
8. Place the baking sheet or dish in the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the mushrooms are tender and the filling is golden brown.
9. Remove the stuffed mushrooms from the oven and allow them to cool for a few minutes before serving.
10. Garnish with additional chopped chives, if desired.
11. Serve warm as an appetizer or side dish. Enjoy!
