## **White Christmas Fudge Recipe**

### **Ingredients:**
- 3 cups white chocolate chips
- 1 (14 oz) can sweetened condensed milk
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup chopped dried cranberries
- 3/4 cup chopped pistachios
- 1/2 cup shredded coconut

### **Instructions:**
1. Line an 8x8 inch baking dish with parchment paper, leaving some overhang for easy removal later.
2. In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the white chocolate chips, sweetened condensed milk, and butter. Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring in between, until the mixture is melted and smooth.
3. Remove the bowl from the microwave and stir in the vanilla extract.
4. Gently fold in the chopped dried cranberries, pistachios, shredded coconut, and mini marshmallows until evenly distributed.
5. Pour the fudge mixture into the prepared baking dish, spreading it out evenly using a spatula.
6. If desired, sprinkle some extra cranberries, pistachios, coconut, and marshmallows on top for decoration.
7. Refrigerate the fudge for at least 4 hours, or until it has completely set.
8. Once the fudge is firm, lift it out of the baking dish using the parchment paper overhang, and transfer it to a cutting board.
9. Cut the fudge into small squares or desired shapes.
10. Serve and enjoy your delicious White Christmas Fudge!
11. Leftover fudge can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
