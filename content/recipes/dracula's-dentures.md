# Recipe: Dracula's Dentures

## Ingredients:
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 48 sliced almonds
- Red food coloring gel (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.
3. In a separate large bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.
4. Add the egg and vanilla extract to the butter mixture, and mix until well combined.
5. Gradually add the dry ingredient mixture to the wet ingredients, stirring until fully incorporated.
6. Divide the dough in half. Take one portion and roll it into a log about 1 inch in diameter.
7. Cut the log into 1 1/2 inch long pieces, giving them an oval shape to resemble dentures.
8. Arrange the denture-shaped pieces on the prepared baking sheet, leaving a little space between them.
9. Gently press two sliced almonds into the dough of each denture to resemble fangs.
10. *Optional: Dab a small amount of red food coloring gel onto the almonds to create a blood-like effect.*
11. Repeat steps 6-10 with the remaining dough.
12. Bake the dentures in the preheated oven for approximately 10-12 minutes, or until firm to the touch.
13. Allow the dentures to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.
14. Serve and enjoy these deliciously spooky Dracula's Dentures!

Note: This recipe makes approximately 48 dentures, depending on the size of the dentures you shape. Adjust the ingredients accordingly if you wish to make more or fewer dentures.
