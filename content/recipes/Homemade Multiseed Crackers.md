# Homemade Multiseed Crackers

## Ingredients:
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup sesame seeds
- 1/4 cup flax seeds
- 1/4 cup sunflower seeds
- 1/4 cup pumpkin seeds
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/2 cup water

## Instructions:
1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, sesame seeds, flax seeds, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, salt, and baking powder.
3. Stir in the olive oil and water. Mix until the dough comes together.
4. Dust your work surface with flour and transfer the dough onto it. Knead the dough for about 2 minutes until it becomes smooth.
5. Divide the dough into two equal parts. Roll out one part of the dough using a rolling pin until it is thin (about 1/8 inch). Transfer the rolled dough onto the prepared baking sheet.
6. Use a knife or a pizza cutter to cut the rolled dough into desired cracker-sized pieces.
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 with the remaining dough.
8. Bake the crackers in the preheated oven for about 12-15 minutes, or until they turn golden brown and crispy.
9. Remove from the oven and let the crackers cool completely on a wire rack.
10. Store the homemade multiseed crackers in an airtight container for up to two weeks.
