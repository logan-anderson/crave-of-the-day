# Recipe: Candied Ginger Pear Slices

## Ingredients:
- 2 large ripe pears
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1 cup water
- 1/4 cup chopped candied ginger
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions:
1. Start by peeling and coring the pears. Slice them into thin, even slices and set them aside.
2. In a medium-sized saucepan, combine the sugar, water, and chopped candied ginger. Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring occasionally until the sugar has completely dissolved.
3. Once the sugar has dissolved, bring the mixture to a simmer and add the pear slices. Cook the pears in the syrup mixture for about 8-10 minutes, or until they become tender.
4. Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Let the pears cool in the syrup for about 10 minutes.
5. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the pear slices to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Make sure the pear slices are arranged in a single layer, without overlapping.
6. Preheat your oven to 200°F (95°C). Place the baking sheet with the pear slices in the oven and bake for approximately 2 hours, or until the pears become slightly dried and candied.
7. Once done, remove the pear slices from the oven and let them cool completely before serving. They can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.
