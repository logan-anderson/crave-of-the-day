These Sweet Potato Pretzels are a delightful twist on classic pretzels. The addition of sweet potato gives them a beautiful golden color and a slightly sweet and earthy taste. These pretzels are perfect for snacking, dipping into your favorite sauce, or enjoying as a side dish. 

## Ingredients

- 2 cups mashed sweet potatoes
- 4 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ cups warm water
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons active dry yeast
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon cinnamon (optional)
- ¼ cup baking soda
- Coarse salt, for sprinkling

## Instructions

1. In a large mixing bowl, dissolve the yeast and brown sugar in warm water. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until frothy.
2. Add the mashed sweet potatoes, flour, salt, and cinnamon (if using) to the yeast mixture. Mix until a dough forms.
3. Transfer the dough onto a floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.
4. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a damp kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours or until doubled in size.
5. Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
6. Punch down the risen dough and divide it into 12 equal portions.
7. Roll each portion into a rope about 20 inches long. Twist the rope into a pretzel shape and place it on the prepared baking sheet.
8. In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Slowly add the baking soda (it will fizz) and stir until dissolved.
9. Gently drop pretzels, one or two at a time, into the boiling water mixture for about 30 seconds, then remove them using a slotted spoon and place them back on the baking sheet.
10. Sprinkle the pretzels with coarse salt and bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown.
11. Remove from the oven and let the pretzels cool slightly before serving.

Enjoy these delicious Sweet Potato Pretzels warm or at room temperature. They make a lovely snack or accompaniment to a hearty meal. Dip them in your favorite mustard or cheese sauce for an extra burst of flavor.
