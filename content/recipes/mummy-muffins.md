## Mummy Muffins Recipe

### Ingredients:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
- 1 cup milk
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 24 candy eyeballs
- 1/4 cup powdered sugar
- 1-2 tablespoons milk

### Instructions:
1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a muffin tin with paper liners.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Mix well.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the melted butter, milk, eggs, and vanilla extract until well combined.
4. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; a few lumps are okay.
5. Spoon the batter evenly into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about two-thirds full.
6. Bake for 15-18 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.
7. Remove the muffins from the oven and let them cool in the tin for a few minutes. Then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.
8. Once the muffins have cooled, prepare the mummy decorations. Mix the powdered sugar and milk together in a small bowl until you have a thick glaze.
9. Drizzle the glaze back and forth across each muffin to create the mummy bandages.
10. Place two candy eyeballs on each muffin to resemble the mummy's eyes.
11. Allow the glaze to set for a few minutes, and your spooky Mummy Muffins are ready to be enjoyed!
