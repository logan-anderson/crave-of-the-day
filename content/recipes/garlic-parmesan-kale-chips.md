# Garlic Parmesan Kale Chips

## Ingredients:
- 1 bunch of kale
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
- Salt and black pepper to taste

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C).
2. Wash and dry the kale leaves thoroughly, then remove the stems and tear the leaves into smaller chip-sized pieces.
3. In a large bowl, drizzle olive oil over the kale leaves and toss them around until they are evenly coated.
4. Sprinkle minced garlic, grated Parmesan cheese, salt, and black pepper over the kale leaves. Toss again to ensure the ingredients are well-distributed.
5. Arrange the seasoned kale leaves in a single layer on a baking sheet, ensuring they are not overlapping.
6. Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the kale chips are crispy and slightly golden around the edges. Keep a close eye on them to prevent burning.
7. Once done, remove the kale chips from the oven and allow them to cool completely before serving.
8. Enjoy your crispy, flavorful Garlic Parmesan Kale Chips!
