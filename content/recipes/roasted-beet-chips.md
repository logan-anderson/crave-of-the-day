# Roasted Beet Chips

***Ingredients:***
- 3-4 medium-sized beets
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon sea salt
- ½ teaspoon black pepper
- Optional: additional seasonings like garlic powder, paprika, or dried herbs

***Instructions:***

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.

2. Peel the beets using a vegetable peeler. Slice the beets very thinly using a mandoline slicer or a sharp knife. Aim for slices that are about ⅛ inch thick.

3. In a large mixing bowl, toss the beet slices with olive oil, sea salt, black pepper, and any other desired seasonings. Make sure the slices are evenly coated with the oil and spices.

4. Arrange the beet slices in a single layer on the prepared baking sheets. Avoid overlapping the slices to ensure even roasting.

5. Place the baking sheets in the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the beet chips are crispy and slightly golden around the edges. Keep an eye on them to prevent burning.

6. Once the chips are done, remove them from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes.

7. Transfer the cooled beet chips to a serving bowl or storage container. They will become even crispier as they cool. Serve immediately or store in an airtight container for up to a week.

Enjoy these nutritious and vibrant roasted beet chips as a flavorful and guilt-free snack!
