## Gruesome Grape Gummies Recipe

### Ingredients:
- 2 cups grape juice
- 1/4 cup unflavored gelatin
- 1/2 cup sugar
- Purple food coloring (optional)
- Gummy mold or ice cube trays

### Instructions:
1. In a saucepan, pour the grape juice and sprinkle the gelatin on top. Let it sit for 5 minutes so the gelatin can soften.
2. Place the saucepan over low heat and stir until the gelatin completely dissolves.
3. Stir in the sugar until it's well combined, and the mixture becomes smooth and slightly thickened. If desired, add a few drops of purple food coloring to enhance the grape color.
4. Remove the saucepan from heat and let the mixture cool slightly for about 3-5 minutes.
5. Carefully pour the grape juice mixture into the gummy mold or ice cube trays.
6. Place the mold or trays in the refrigerator and let them chill for at least 2 hours until the gummies are set.
7. Once set, remove the gummies from the mold or trays by gently pushing them out or using a butter knife to loosen the edges.
8. Serve your Gruesome Grape Gummies immediately, or store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week.
