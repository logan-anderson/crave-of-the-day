# Candy Corn Popsicles

**Ingredients:**
- 1 cup orange juice
- 1 cup coconut milk
- 1/4 cup honey
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Orange food coloring
- Yellow food coloring

**Instructions:**
1. In a mixing bowl, combine the orange juice, coconut milk, honey, and vanilla extract. Stir well until the honey is completely dissolved.
2. Divide the mixture into three equal parts.
3. In one part, add a few drops of orange food coloring and mix until you achieve the desired shade of orange.
4. In another part, add a few drops of yellow food coloring and mix until you achieve the desired shade of yellow.
5. Leave the third part uncolored, representing the white portion of the candy corn.
6. Get your popsicle molds ready.
7. Pour a layer of the orange mixture into each popsicle mold, filling about one-third of the mold.
8. Place the molds in the freezer for about 30 minutes or until the mixture is partially frozen.
9. Once partially frozen, remove the molds from the freezer and pour a layer of the yellow mixture on top of the orange layer, filling another one-third of the mold.
10. Return the molds to the freezer for another 30 minutes or until the mixture is partially frozen again.
11. Finally, pour a layer of the uncolored mixture on top of the yellow layer, filling the remaining one-third of the mold.
12. Insert popsicle sticks into each mold and freeze for at least 4 hours or overnight to ensure fully frozen popsicles.
13. Once fully frozen, gently unmold the popsicles by running warm water over the bottom of the molds.
14. Serve and enjoy your homemade candy corn popsicles!
